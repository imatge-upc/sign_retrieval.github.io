-d5dN54tH2E-1-rgb_front_00000|we're going to work on a arm drill that will help you have graceful hand movements in front of you
-d5dN54tH2E-1-rgb_front_00001|i call it painting the wall
-d5dN54tH2E-1-rgb_front_00002|so this one what you're going to start with let's take one hand first; it's going to the wrist is going to come down and the wrist is going to come up
-d5dN54tH2E-1-rgb_front_00003|so basically your wrist is going to be leading the movement and let the fingers follow nice and relaxed where the wrist is going
-d5dN54tH2E-1-rgb_front_00004|don't let the fingers take over let the wrist do all the guiding
-d5dN54tH2E-1-rgb_front_00005|let's make sure that are feet are parallel and are knees are soft
-d5dN54tH2E-1-rgb_front_00006|our belly buttons pulled in pressing in towards our spine and our chest is lifted and our arms are relaxed; are shoulders are nice and relaxed
-d5dN54tH2E-1-rgb_front_00007|so let's start with the one hand going up and down
-d5dN54tH2E-1-rgb_front_00008|we're going to keep this right in front of us; you don't want to have it in front of your face so you block yourself
-d5dN54tH2E-1-rgb_front_00009|you want it right in front of your solar plexus
-d5dN54tH2E-1-rgb_front_00010|so we're going to go up and down; let's switch hands down and up; down and up
-d5dN54tH2E-1-rgb_front_00011|and just let those fingers relax
-d5dN54tH2E-1-rgb_front_00012|now together you're going to go opposite
-d5dN54tH2E-1-rgb_front_00013|do it very mechanically at first and then slowly soften it out as you feel comfortable
-d5dN54tH2E-1-rgb_front_00014|it's real easy to actually get your fingers to lead so try not to let them do that
-d5dN54tH2E-1-rgb_front_00015|let the wrist do all the leading
-f1_kdl050s-1-rgb_front_00016|in this clip we are going to talk about dangers for these birds in the household and otherwise
-f1_kdl050s-1-rgb_front_00017|the number one loss for these birds is flight
-f1_kdl050s-1-rgb_front_00018|if these guys are flighted you need to be really careful if you have them loose in your household
-f1_kdl050s-1-rgb_front_00019|a lot of these birds aren't tame
-f1_kdl050s-1-rgb_front_00020|people get them and they only have two or three of them
-f1_kdl050s-1-rgb_front_00021|as you are opening the cage doors to clean their cages these guys will get startled and fly away
-f1_kdl050s-1-rgb_front_00022|and when they panic they fly and they don't come back
-f1_kdl050s-1-rgb_front_00023|they fly out your windows
-f1_kdl050s-1-rgb_front_00024|they fly out your front door
-f1_kdl050s-1-rgb_front_00025|you will be thinking that every thing is sealed and you go clean the papers and your daughter son husband walks in through the front door and that bird just flies right out
-f1_kdl050s-1-rgb_front_00026|you need to be very careful when cleaning their cages if these birds are flighted
-f1_kdl050s-1-rgb_front_00027|it seems to be the number one way to loose them
-f1_kdl050s-1-rgb_front_00028|once they get loose outside predators will get to them very quickly
-f1_kdl050s-1-rgb_front_00029|these guys are not suited to live in the united states they are not native here and they don't survive
-f1_kdl050s-1-rgb_front_00030|the other dangers you need to worry about is teflon pans
-f1_kdl050s-1-rgb_front_00031|if they are heated to a high temperature they give off some fumes that the birds inhale which causes them basically to fell off their perch dead
-f1_kdl050s-1-rgb_front_00032|there is nothing that you can do about it and it is very quickly
-f1_kdl050s-1-rgb_front_00033|it is kind of a silent killer
-f1_kdl050s-1-rgb_front_00034|so if you have them in the kitchen and if you are going to cook with teflon move them to another room in the house so that you can protect them
-f1_kdl050s-1-rgb_front_00035|aerosols spraying for bugs spraying perfumes around the house all those sort of things these birds have very very sensitive upper repository tracts and so if you have any sort of aerosol it can irritate their lungs
-f1_kdl050s-1-rgb_front_00036|and these guys only have a few breaths before they'll die
-f1_kdl050s-1-rgb_front_00037|so you need to be very careful with aerosols around the house
-f1_kdl050s-1-rgb_front_00038|and lastly they are so so tiny basically anything in your house a dog a cat anything they can get squished in a door if they get mouthed even a little tiny bit by your dog or cat or by your kid they will just squished
-f1_kdl050s-1-rgb_front_00039|there is not a whole lot to them they are not that robust they are mostly feathers
-f1_kdl050s-1-rgb_front_00040|you have to be fairly careful with these birds
-f1_kdl050s-1-rgb_front_00041|at least in a physical way
-f1_kdl050s-1-rgb_front_00042|those are most of your household dangers
-f1_kdl050s-1-rgb_front_00043|and again if you are cooking and the birds are loose be careful with them landing on a hot pan
-f1_kdl050s-1-rgb_front_00044|you don't want toilet seats open if they are flying around your house because they can fly in it and drowned
-f1_kdl050s-1-rgb_front_00045|just be careful you want to make sure that if you ever let these guys loose out of their cage you basically bombproof your house
-f1_kdl050s-1-rgb_front_00046|you make sure that every little nook and cranny has been looked at for
-f1_kdl050s-1-rgb_front_00047|and if they are alone in their cages and if you have smaller pets and it is a smaller cage they cannot knock their cage over and let either the bird to fly out or they can't reach through the bars
-f1_kdl050s-1-rgb_front_00048|like a cat might dig through the bars if they are small enough and be able to grab hold of the bird
-f1_kdl050s-1-rgb_front_00049|and if the bird is outside if you let these guys outside to get some fresh sunshine raccoons have been known to break into their cages and tear through the bars and ripped into these guys
-f1_kdl050s-1-rgb_front_00050|so you have to be very careful if you leave them outside for any period of time
-f1_kdl050s-1-rgb_front_00051|that more or less covers it just be careful because your birds are very small and much more sensitive to chemicals then many other pets are
00dWJ4YRRSI-1-rgb_front_00052|i hope this becomes very popular here of late is the circle hooks now circle hooks has been used by japanese fishermen and longliners for years and years but in recent years they've developed lighter smaller in shore type hooks which are very well suited particularly to folks that are in to the hook and release type fishing
00dWJ4YRRSI-1-rgb_front_00053|this hook basically is designed to catch the fish in the corner of the mouth
00dWJ4YRRSI-1-rgb_front_00054|now this type of hook when you get a bite you can't jerk the rod to set the hook
00dWJ4YRRSI-1-rgb_front_00055|you basically just reel down and get the line tight and the fish will take off and when he does he usually turns and this hook comes right in the corner of his mouth and it sort of acts really like a kind of like a bottle opener
00dWJ4YRRSI-1-rgb_front_00056|once you get it in there it is very difficult to remove this hook so if you catch a lot of fish when you hook up the fish you rarely ever lose them because of that particular mechanism
00dWJ4YRRSI-1-rgb_front_00057|the nice thing about the circle hook is you don't gut hook a lot of fish
00dWJ4YRRSI-1-rgb_front_00058|you don't damage a lot of fish
00dWJ4YRRSI-1-rgb_front_00059|you simply get him up to the boat
00dWJ4YRRSI-1-rgb_front_00060|if you want to release him you can release him or cut the hook out and it's a pretty it's a pretty friendly hook for fishing
0oGfy530AuI-1-rgb_front_00061|michael rosengart: thrusters
0oGfy530AuI-1-rgb_front_00062|right now we're going to get into a more complicated exercise
0oGfy530AuI-1-rgb_front_00063|we're integrating more of the body
0oGfy530AuI-1-rgb_front_00064|and we're going to develop more strength because we're getting more of the body parts working together at the same time in cohesion
0oGfy530AuI-1-rgb_front_00065|okay
0oGfy530AuI-1-rgb_front_00066|so jonesy you want to go ahead and show what a thruster is
0oGfy530AuI-1-rgb_front_00067|jonesy going to take a couple of dumbbells bring it up to his shoulders
0oGfy530AuI-1-rgb_front_00068|and we're basically he's going to sit back into a squat
0oGfy530AuI-1-rgb_front_00069|and we're basically combining a squat and a shoulder press but it's not that simple
0oGfy530AuI-1-rgb_front_00070|it's not segmented like that
0oGfy530AuI-1-rgb_front_00071|jonesy is going to sit back
0oGfy530AuI-1-rgb_front_00072|and as he drives up again driving on his heel driving his hips forward is the work from his hips that will then force the arms up
0oGfy530AuI-1-rgb_front_00073|good
0oGfy530AuI-1-rgb_front_00074|and then there's a lot of arm strength involved to stabilize the dumbbell right above his shoulders
0oGfy530AuI-1-rgb_front_00075|not out to the side not back but right above
0oGfy530AuI-1-rgb_front_00076|that's good
0oGfy530AuI-1-rgb_front_00077|good work jonesy
0oGfy530AuI-1-rgb_front_00078|again working from the heels up work with your breath; feel that you're driving your hips forward and up each time good work
0oGfy530AuI-1-rgb_front_00079|do ten of those and we're going to take a three to five minute break and then come back to it
0oGfy530AuI-1-rgb_front_00080|again i want to make sure that you understand that when you're doing the thruster that it's working from the ground up and it is one smooth movement
0oGfy530AuI-1-rgb_front_00081|it's not segmented
0oGfy530AuI-1-rgb_front_00082|it's not the squat and a shoulder press okay
0oGfy530AuI-1-rgb_front_00083|it's one smooth movement
0oGfy530AuI-1-rgb_front_00084|try it
0pKzG0RRUz4-1-rgb_front_00085|another technique is you can braid the hair on first and then start wrapping cause some people have really short hair and we can create the look with adding the hair end
0pKzG0RRUz4-1-rgb_front_00086|so no matter what the length of your hair long as it's long enough to add a at the hair on we can start by braiding it on then braid then wrap and you can make this as thick as you like whatever size you like whatever color you like
0pKzG0RRUz4-1-rgb_front_00087|i like the lock extensions because it's not damaging to your hair at all because you can add color without actually coloring your hair you just wrap on a different color
0pKzG0RRUz4-1-rgb_front_00088|i really like that
0pKzG0RRUz4-1-rgb_front_00089|you can get instant length which i love
0pKzG0RRUz4-1-rgb_front_00090|and we have a skinny one and we have a little fatter one
0pKzG0RRUz4-1-rgb_front_00091|and we can them even fatter
0pKzG0RRUz4-1-rgb_front_00092|whatever length we can just keep on adding hair forever and ever and it will just go on and on
0pKzG0RRUz4-1-rgb_front_00093|we can make them as long as we want
0pKzG0RRUz4-2-rgb_front_00094|another technique is you can braid the hair on first and then start wrapping cause some people have really short hair and we can create the look with adding the hair end
0pKzG0RRUz4-2-rgb_front_00095|so no matter what the length of your hair long as it's long enough to add a at the hair on we can start by braiding it on then braid then wrap and you can make this as thick as you like whatever size you like whatever color you like
0pKzG0RRUz4-2-rgb_front_00096|i like the lock extensions because it's not damaging to your hair at all because you can add color without actually coloring your hair you just wrap on a different color
0pKzG0RRUz4-2-rgb_front_00097|i really like that

0pKzG0RRUz4-2-rgb_front_00099|and we have a skinny one and we have a little fatter one
0pKzG0RRUz4-2-rgb_front_00100|and we can them even fatter
0pKzG0RRUz4-2-rgb_front_00101|whatever length we can just keep on adding hair forever and ever and it will just go on and on
0pKzG0RRUz4-2-rgb_front_00102|we can make them as long as we want
0zvsqf23tmw-1-rgb_front_00103|and in this segment i'm going to just start paint in the background color
0zvsqf23tmw-1-rgb_front_00104|and when you do a children's wall mural you probably most likely want to always start with like your sky first
0zvsqf23tmw-1-rgb_front_00105|you want to do your background before you get all your objects and those are--it should always be last
0zvsqf23tmw-1-rgb_front_00106|so what i've got here is i've got a little bit of benjamin moore acrylic paint and i've got it in a--it's a flat paint
0zvsqf23tmw-1-rgb_front_00107|and i've also got a cheap brush and i'm just going to kinda dry-brush it a little bit onto the wall
0zvsqf23tmw-1-rgb_front_00108|and i'm not going to do way solid onto the wall
0zvsqf23tmw-1-rgb_front_00109|i'm just going to start kinda tapping it on and getting the wall color on there
0zvsqf23tmw-1-rgb_front_00110|and if i need to mix it down a little bit then i can always use a little bit of medium or a little bit of water to dilute it
0zvsqf23tmw-1-rgb_front_00111|and i'll just keep painting on here
0zvsqf23tmw-1-rgb_front_00112|i'm going to start on the edge so i can get the edge painted in against the skyline
0zvsqf23tmw-1-rgb_front_00113|i'm just doing a dark hill here
0zvsqf23tmw-1-rgb_front_00114|i'm trying to define the edges and then kinda just dry-brush it to fill it in a little bit
0zvsqf23tmw-1-rgb_front_00115|i don't want too much paint on the wall
0zvsqf23tmw-1-rgb_front_00116|and you really don't need to use a lot of paint
0zvsqf23tmw-1-rgb_front_00117|you don't need a lot of paint on your brush
0zvsqf23tmw-1-rgb_front_00118|you want to just kinda take it easy and then use more paint as you start filling in your details
0zvsqf23tmw-1-rgb_front_00119|so right now we're just kinda put a tiny bit of paint on there
0zvsqf23tmw-1-rgb_front_00120|and this entire mural is going to kinda fade in to the wall
0zvsqf23tmw-1-rgb_front_00121|it's not going to be a wall-to-wall mural so i just want to make sure that i use less paint the farther out that i go

1-xK5UtDSmE-2-rgb_front_00141|we're going to look at it from several aspects and the first thing that i would want to speak to would be the owner of the business the ceo and in my profession and i work for a company that provides wellness programs
1-xK5UtDSmE-2-rgb_front_00142|we've been doing this for a number of years and have been quite successful at producing results
1-xK5UtDSmE-2-rgb_front_00143|and so the real key to it is you mr ceo you mr owner of the business and why would that be
1-xK5UtDSmE-2-rgb_front_00144|well if you are not healthy can you have a healthy organization
1-xK5UtDSmE-2-rgb_front_00145|if you are not setting the example if you are not being the leader then who's going to lead
1-xK5UtDSmE-2-rgb_front_00146|i've spoken with several different companies and i can remember one particular bank president in his senior vice president we sat down together and we started to talk about the subject of because he wanted a wellness program that's why i was there
1-xK5UtDSmE-2-rgb_front_00147|and so we started talking about it and i said to him well you know there are certain things that are required to have a really a healthy group of employees
1-xK5UtDSmE-2-rgb_front_00148|and i said well one of them would be exercise
1-xK5UtDSmE-2-rgb_front_00149|you are going to have to have someway of getting your employees involved with regular exercise
1-xK5UtDSmE-2-rgb_front_00150|another one is drinking water we're going to get into these in a little more detail
1-xK5UtDSmE-2-rgb_front_00151|another one would be eating a proper diet
1-xK5UtDSmE-2-rgb_front_00152|and you know when we got to that i said you know it's not just eating the right foods but it's also eliminating some of the bad foods
1-xK5UtDSmE-2-rgb_front_00153|and i said you know like ice cream ice cream is great but if you eat ice cream all the time it's got so much sugar in it it's really going have an effect and the president said whoa you can't go there that's my favorite food
1-xK5UtDSmE-2-rgb_front_00154|and so then i said well maybe soda would be something that you would start with as
1-xK5UtDSmE-2-rgb_front_00155|and he said whoa wait the vice president said we can't go there because you know because he's addicted to soda
1-xK5UtDSmE-2-rgb_front_00156|and so the net after our presentation i called back and i wasn't getting any callbacks
1-xK5UtDSmE-2-rgb_front_00157|we want a wellness program but we really don't want to lead
1-xK5UtDSmE-2-rgb_front_00158|but when you think about that is that going to get the job done for you
1-xK5UtDSmE-2-rgb_front_00159|so i speak to you mr ceo mr corporate owner mr corporate president you that are trying to produce something positive in your company you need to pay attention to your own health
1-xK5UtDSmE-2-rgb_front_00160|think about it if you have a heart attack if you are hit with cancer what is that going to do to your organization
11JT4jRNI-o-2-rgb_front_00161|let's go to the squat position now and add the tubing into that
11JT4jRNI-o-2-rgb_front_00162|again so many variations
11JT4jRNI-o-2-rgb_front_00163|i'm going to show you something simple and basic
11JT4jRNI-o-2-rgb_front_00164|i've got my feet about shoulder width apart pretty much have to to do a descent squat
11JT4jRNI-o-2-rgb_front_00165|i'm going to take my tubing up and i'm going to open up my palms so they're facing forward
11JT4jRNI-o-2-rgb_front_00166|what am i doing with this
11JT4jRNI-o-2-rgb_front_00167|as i go down and up in a squat position i have to resist the tubing right
11JT4jRNI-o-2-rgb_front_00168|it's trying to keep me from coming up
11JT4jRNI-o-2-rgb_front_00169|as i stretch the tubing straight up and down it makes the squat harder
11JT4jRNI-o-2-rgb_front_00170|once again you don't want to bend forward too much on this
11JT4jRNI-o-2-rgb_front_00171|the key on this one and something to keep in mind on this position is this
11JT4jRNI-o-2-rgb_front_00172|if you're tubing is really tight you might not be able to get up unless your legs are close together
11JT4jRNI-o-2-rgb_front_00173|a squat position close together doesn't work very well
11JT4jRNI-o-2-rgb_front_00174|so the key on something like this is that your tubing what you've purchased or what you have has enough flexibility that when you stand on it you can really stand wide
11JT4jRNI-o-2-rgb_front_00175|but it's definitely a great exercise and i highly recommend it
1G8LIWgKLME-2-rgb_front_00176|to begin your dotted nail art you're going to need to use a stylus also known as a dotter
1G8LIWgKLME-2-rgb_front_00177|a stylus comes with different size rounded ends on it anywhere ranging from very small to very large
1G8LIWgKLME-2-rgb_front_00178|there's also sizes in between depending on the design you're wanting to do
1G8LIWgKLME-2-rgb_front_00179|for a very small intricate design like an i you're going to want to use the smallest size that you have where as if you're wanting to do something large such as the sun you're going to want to use the largest end that you have
1G8LIWgKLME-2-rgb_front_00180|there's also sizes if you wanted to do things like buttons or just small designs like that
1G8LIWgKLME-2-rgb_front_00181|for your polish color you're going to want to use a polish that is either complimentary or contrasting
1G8LIWgKLME-2-rgb_front_00182|i prefer contrasting just so that the design actually sticks out and stands better and so that it is more easily available to be seen
1QmgK8f5JnY-1-rgb_front_00183|hello my names rebecca herrick i'm a licensed massage therapist in wilmington north carolina and i'm here to give my review on massage parlors
1QmgK8f5JnY-1-rgb_front_00184|first of all massage parlor is a very dated term and often has some negative connotations that are associated with it and as a massage therapist we worked hard to kind of steer away from that and you know work hard to get the respect that the therapeutic aspect of massage therapy deserves
1QmgK8f5JnY-1-rgb_front_00185|so having said that when you're looking for a place to have a massage you can call it a massage therapy center or a wellness center something of that nature and when you're doing so you want to always make sure that you check the background of the location and also of the therapist practicing there
1QmgK8f5JnY-1-rgb_front_00186|you always want to make sure that you get the highest quality care by receiving massage from the most educated and absolutely licensed therapist
1QmgK8f5JnY-1-rgb_front_00187|you can check with local networks newspapers other massage therapists in the area for reviews on massage therapy centers in your area and that would be my take on massage parlor reviews
1V-aOg8wCT4-1-rgb_front_00188|how can i create great sponsorships for my golf tournament you cry
1V-aOg8wCT4-1-rgb_front_00189|well no worries because that's exactly what this segment is about
1V-aOg8wCT4-1-rgb_front_00190|let's take a look at some of the perks you can offer potential sponsors
1V-aOg8wCT4-1-rgb_front_00191|to begin with you can utilize your very own golf program that you're going to be printing
1V-aOg8wCT4-1-rgb_front_00192|now depending on the size of the sponsorship you can offer quarter page half page or full-page ads
1V-aOg8wCT4-1-rgb_front_00193|title sponsors might get advertisement on the front the back cover of the actual program
1V-aOg8wCT4-1-rgb_front_00194|another great perk; offer a vendor table at the event
1V-aOg8wCT4-1-rgb_front_00195|companies will love the idea that they get to interact with the actual golfers at the event
1V-aOg8wCT4-1-rgb_front_00196|now lets not forget your charity or event website
1V-aOg8wCT4-1-rgb_front_00197|this is a great place to promote your sponsors as well
1V-aOg8wCT4-1-rgb_front_00198|you can do this through banners links to their website or actual ads on your site promoting the sponsor
1V-aOg8wCT4-1-rgb_front_00199|finally i hope you're going to hand out lots and lots of flyers
1V-aOg8wCT4-1-rgb_front_00200|a flyer is a great way to promote the sponsor
1V-aOg8wCT4-1-rgb_front_00201|again depending on the level they might just get their website listed
1V-aOg8wCT4-1-rgb_front_00202|if it's a large sponsor they can have their logo or their full ad
1V-aOg8wCT4-1-rgb_front_00203|the more colorful and bright the flyer the better
1V-aOg8wCT4-1-rgb_front_00204|remember sponsors are looking for potential customers promotion and publicity
1V-aOg8wCT4-1-rgb_front_00205|also remember a happy sponsor is sure to come back year after year after year
1aJwX9nRlmk-2-rgb_front_00206|elizabeth rose: the next thing we're going to do is bring some movement into this area with all the tension where your headache is happening
1aJwX9nRlmk-2-rgb_front_00207|so i'm going to put my hair back so that you guys can see it it's a little bit easier
1aJwX9nRlmk-2-rgb_front_00208|all that's going to happen is you're going to be seated in your easy seated pose again with your sits bone on the floor or on a block
1aJwX9nRlmk-2-rgb_front_00209|you're going to inhale and the crown of the head reaches up so that you're sitting tall but you're not going to be propped this way
1aJwX9nRlmk-2-rgb_front_00210|if you're sitting this way then just relax so that your shoulder blades fall down on either side of the spine but the crown of your head is still reaching up
1aJwX9nRlmk-2-rgb_front_00211|you're going to inhale and then as you exhale just gently drop the right ear toward the right shoulder
1aJwX9nRlmk-2-rgb_front_00212|notice how my shoulders don't creep up--[sounds like] errk--as i drop the ear down right
1aJwX9nRlmk-2-rgb_front_00213|they're going to stay exactly where they are and feeling my shoulder blades melting down on either side of the spine and i'm exhaling to just drop my right ear toward the right shoulder
1aJwX9nRlmk-2-rgb_front_00214|take a couple breaths here inhaling and exhaling and then in and out through the nose remember
1aJwX9nRlmk-2-rgb_front_00215|and then on an exhale you're going to go ahead and let the chin fall toward the chest
1aJwX9nRlmk-2-rgb_front_00216|again when you're here the shoulders aren't creeping up
1aJwX9nRlmk-2-rgb_front_00217|they're still melting down on either side of the spine
1aJwX9nRlmk-2-rgb_front_00218|you're going to inhale think of breathing into the back of the neck and between the shoulder blades and exhale
1aJwX9nRlmk-2-rgb_front_00219|stick with your 3-part breath into the belly into the ribcage and then into the heart
1aJwX9nRlmk-2-rgb_front_00220|then as you inhale you're going to let the left ear come over toward the left shoulder
1aJwX9nRlmk-2-rgb_front_00221|notice again the right shoulder isn't going to pop up and the left shoulder isn't going to come up to support the ear in your chest
1aJwX9nRlmk-2-rgb_front_00222|just keep then gently falling down
1aJwX9nRlmk-2-rgb_front_00223|so inhale and lift your ear up and you're going to breathe here
1aJwX9nRlmk-2-rgb_front_00224|now slowly begin to connect these movements exhaling as you drop the chin toward the chest and inhaling as the ear rolls up towards the shoulder blades and do this as long as you're comfortable
1aJwX9nRlmk-2-rgb_front_00225|i'd say at least 20 repetitions
1aJwX9nRlmk-2-rgb_front_00226|if you can keep it going for a minute that's great but stick with the breath
1aJwX9nRlmk-2-rgb_front_00227|let the breath be the emphasis for every movement and don't ever let yourself give the breath away
204P_kHHWks-2-rgb_front_00228|now i've been applying product to both eyes and i'm finishing out the top of the left side of her eye
204P_kHHWks-2-rgb_front_00229|open relax and open those eyes
204P_kHHWks-2-rgb_front_00230|then i look for even and these are beautifully evenly done
204P_kHHWks-2-rgb_front_00231|then what i would do is get ice packs out and before i even start the bottoms just to relieve any kind of swelling and for comfort i would ice pack her eyes and let her relax and take five minutes while i set up for the step two to the bottom eyes
279MO2nwC_E-2-rgb_front_00232|in this section we are going to talk about full body movement
279MO2nwC_E-2-rgb_front_00233|so what i mean by full body movement is from your upper body down to your lower body
279MO2nwC_E-2-rgb_front_00234|your upper body you do not want to be timid or shy i know it is going to feel a little silly if you do not really move your arms but you should really be moving your arms
279MO2nwC_E-2-rgb_front_00235|and the reason you will see is that arm movement a lot especially when the intensity increases and let's say you come to that hill you really want to make sure you move your arms because you are now circulating a lot of blood flow evenly throughout your body and you are getting more oxygen into your lungs and you are breathing in that fresh air and blowing it back out with full body movement
279MO2nwC_E-2-rgb_front_00236|now as far as your lower body your legs you want to make sure that you put most of the weight down your calves
279MO2nwC_E-2-rgb_front_00237|so you see if i was running as i am running i am putting most of the weight on my calves and i am moving my body and i am moving my arms and my shoulders
279MO2nwC_E-2-rgb_front_00238|and breathing in through the nose and breathing out through the mouth
279MO2nwC_E-2-rgb_front_00239|and will you notice the difference the next time you run just remember in your mind what i said
279MO2nwC_E-2-rgb_front_00240|the more that you move your arms you are going to see yourself increasing in speed and you are going to see the increase in oxygen level compared to just standing there which does very little movement
279MO2nwC_E-2-rgb_front_00241|so you really want to make sure that you do that full body movement throughout your whole entire body especially as a cross country runner
2SnVWW3MOB4-2-rgb_front_00242|we are talking about what hairstyles suit a diamond shape face
2SnVWW3MOB4-2-rgb_front_00243|you want to reduce the width at the sides so you want to go with a bob something short
2SnVWW3MOB4-2-rgb_front_00244|probably a little bit shorter then this but something like this would be good
2SnVWW3MOB4-2-rgb_front_00245|diamond shape faces need a narrow side and at the chin so if it came down to the chin that would be really good it would complete your look
2SnVWW3MOB4-2-rgb_front_00246|avoid wearing height on top or volume on the sides
2SnVWW3MOB4-2-rgb_front_00247|you can use a bang to cover a narrow forehead or something like this would be really great right about here like this really helps change the shape of the face and give you a better look throughout
2ri5HYm48MA-2-rgb_front_00248|rebecca sato: hi
2ri5HYm48MA-2-rgb_front_00249|and we're going to talk about character development and how to create really great characters that people are passionate about
2ri5HYm48MA-2-rgb_front_00250|and it doesn't matter if they love them or they hate them or they love to hate them preferably a little of everything
2ri5HYm48MA-2-rgb_front_00251|not necessarily with the same character that will be a little conflicted but with a range of characters that people are having this emotional experience and are able to identify with these people as they read
2ri5HYm48MA-2-rgb_front_00252|and right now i'm talking primarily about stories whether it's short stories or novels but this actually also applies to all kinds of writing even copywriting and advertising and if you're writing a storyboard for a commercial
2ri5HYm48MA-2-rgb_front_00253|i mean you still want to know how to develop good characters
2ri5HYm48MA-2-rgb_front_00254|but primarily i'll be talking about it from the standpoint of traditional story
2ri5HYm48MA-2-rgb_front_00255|so one thing that i find to be very helpful and that a lot of really great writers have mentioned--and these are writers who are rich and famous so it's obviously worked for them--is to develop a really great character
2ri5HYm48MA-2-rgb_front_00256|it helps to have a little bit of information but not too much information
2ri5HYm48MA-2-rgb_front_00257|so what they do is they pick someone for each character that they think kind of embodies that character someone who realizes that they know but that they don't know too well
2ri5HYm48MA-2-rgb_front_00258|and what they do is every time they're writing from that character's perspective or about that character they will think what would that person that i know do how would they react how would they sound how would they look and kind of look at that from that perspective
2ri5HYm48MA-2-rgb_front_00259|and what's nice is that it's not someone that you know super well and so there's still a lot of room for imagination and creative interpretation which i think is very important and we should let it do that
2ri5HYm48MA-2-rgb_front_00260|so basically you have this really great base where you know the person enough that you have something to start with but you don't know him so well that it takes away their wonder
2ri5HYm48MA-2-rgb_front_00261|so try that with your characters and that should really give you something to start with a really great framework
2yudAtTnZrg-1-rgb_front_00262|now you put the eggs in before you put your flour mixture in
2yudAtTnZrg-1-rgb_front_00263|like i said if you still have a little crisco and it is floating around it is okay
2yudAtTnZrg-1-rgb_front_00264|at this time i'm going to add my flour and it takes 6 cups so you need to get
2yudAtTnZrg-1-rgb_front_00265|it is great if you have one of these really big measuring cups
2yudAtTnZrg-1-rgb_front_00266|let me see
2yudAtTnZrg-1-rgb_front_00267|let's get the glasses
2yudAtTnZrg-1-rgb_front_00268|let me see if i have i only have 4 in there
2yudAtTnZrg-1-rgb_front_00269|let me add some more
2yudAtTnZrg-1-rgb_front_00270|okay i have my 6 cups
2yudAtTnZrg-1-rgb_front_00271|now this is you just don't put the whole thing in there you have to gradually put your flour in there
2yudAtTnZrg-1-rgb_front_00272|let me repeat you do not want to just throw it in your flour all at once
2yudAtTnZrg-1-rgb_front_00273|just gradually do it
2yudAtTnZrg-1-rgb_front_00274|maybe a couple of cups at a time
33YRZ5UZTA4-2-rgb_front_00275|jason painter: hi i'm jason
33YRZ5UZTA4-2-rgb_front_00276|today we're painting on glass
33YRZ5UZTA4-2-rgb_front_00277|we have put the first coat the liner and the fill in on all three of the steps
33YRZ5UZTA4-2-rgb_front_00278|it's looking like it's ready now to be--we can really start touching up the liner
33YRZ5UZTA4-2-rgb_front_00279|we can really start touching up the black
33YRZ5UZTA4-2-rgb_front_00280|if we look at it we can see spots that-that filled in and spots that didn't and we don't have to worry about how these thick line--it really looks bad right now but we're just in the beginning stages
33YRZ5UZTA4-2-rgb_front_00281|so really those we want to do is make sure that all of the black lines connect everywhere that we know they're going to need to and all of the lines are filled in that we know we're going to need to
33YRZ5UZTA4-2-rgb_front_00282|so we just take the angle brush back again get black back out and really the less paint you have on here the better just a very little on the tip of your brush
33YRZ5UZTA4-2-rgb_front_00283|this line right here needs to be filled in and we're not actually going to make any brush strokes
33YRZ5UZTA4-2-rgb_front_00284|we're just going to set the paint right on it
33YRZ5UZTA4-2-rgb_front_00285|fill that in just like that
33YRZ5UZTA4-2-rgb_front_00286|we don't have to do anything anymore
33YRZ5UZTA4-2-rgb_front_00287|we'll be defeating the purpose
33YRZ5UZTA4-2-rgb_front_00288|we'll just spread that paint out thinner and thinner and just be frustrated in the end
33YRZ5UZTA4-2-rgb_front_00289|so this line here is not touching
33YRZ5UZTA4-2-rgb_front_00290|we can just put a little dab of black there same as up here
33YRZ5UZTA4-2-rgb_front_00291|just basically just want everything to touch and that's going to make a big difference when we fill in with the white
33YRZ5UZTA4-2-rgb_front_00292|so go ahead and fill in everywhere that you gotta fill in and look at it and we'll wait for that to dry
33YRZ5UZTA4-2-rgb_front_00293|and touch up the white
33jxeIIbBnM-1-rgb_front_00294|hi my name is dave andrews
33jxeIIbBnM-1-rgb_front_00295|today i'm going to show you how to run a macro in excel from access
33jxeIIbBnM-1-rgb_front_00296|let's begin by opening up excel
33jxeIIbBnM-1-rgb_front_00297|let's first create our macro by clicking the view tab
33jxeIIbBnM-1-rgb_front_00298|go into macros and saying record macro
33jxeIIbBnM-1-rgb_front_00299|we're going to name this macro one just say okay
33jxeIIbBnM-1-rgb_front_00300|all this macro is going to do is type the number one two three four across the top row
33jxeIIbBnM-1-rgb_front_00301|so let's stop record by clicking this little drop down arrow and saying stop record
33jxeIIbBnM-1-rgb_front_00302|now we have our macro created
33jxeIIbBnM-1-rgb_front_00303|so let's save this as a macro enable workbook
33jxeIIbBnM-1-rgb_front_00304|click on your office button
33jxeIIbBnM-1-rgb_front_00305|go to save as
33jxeIIbBnM-1-rgb_front_00306|we're going to save macro enable workbook
33jxeIIbBnM-1-rgb_front_00307|let's name it book one and just say save
33jxeIIbBnM-1-rgb_front_00308|now we need to go into access by clicking the start button all programs microsoft office
33jxeIIbBnM-1-rgb_front_00309|let's open access
33jxeIIbBnM-1-rgb_front_00310|we need to create a new database by clicking on the office button and saying new
33jxeIIbBnM-1-rgb_front_00311|let's leave the name as database one and say create
33jxeIIbBnM-1-rgb_front_00312|here's our new database
33jxeIIbBnM-1-rgb_front_00313|to run that macro from excel macro from access hold down the alt key on the keyboard
33jxeIIbBnM-1-rgb_front_00314|press f11
33jxeIIbBnM-1-rgb_front_00315|this brings up the visual basic code editor
33jxeIIbBnM-1-rgb_front_00316|go to the top
33jxeIIbBnM-1-rgb_front_00317|say insert
33jxeIIbBnM-1-rgb_front_00318|we're going to say module
33jxeIIbBnM-1-rgb_front_00319|in our code editor we're going to begin typing in some code
33jxeIIbBnM-1-rgb_front_00320|now that we have our function created in access i'm going to go over it with you real quick
33jxeIIbBnM-1-rgb_front_00321|first thing it does is it creates a variable called excel and the sign says excel value
33jxeIIbBnM-1-rgb_front_00322|to the create object function it launches a new excel dot application scheme
33jxeIIbBnM-1-rgb_front_00323|it then opens up a excel database that we give to it which is the path right here that i typed in and then it simply says excel dot run and then the name of the macro we created which was macro one
33jxeIIbBnM-1-rgb_front_00324|you then could link to this function excel test within an object in your database
33jxeIIbBnM-1-rgb_front_00325|my name is dave andrews and i just showed you how to run an excel macro from access
39FN42e41r0-1-rgb_front_00326|michael rosengart: right now i'm here with two personal trainers ryan regensburg and jonesy and we're doing some renegade rows
39FN42e41r0-1-rgb_front_00327|so what i want you to do is go ahead and get into a push up position with two dumbbells in your hands whereas ryan's going to show us later on a little variation for it
39FN42e41r0-1-rgb_front_00328|jonesy's here in a push up position
39FN42e41r0-1-rgb_front_00329|and what you're going to do is you're going to pull one of the dumbbells up into your rib cage shifting your weight back and forth
39FN42e41r0-1-rgb_front_00330|now if you're just starting on this you may want to work with really wide feet
39FN42e41r0-1-rgb_front_00331|that will give you more balance and support as you perform alright
39FN42e41r0-1-rgb_front_00332|at the same time if you want a little bit more of a challenge bring your feet closer together as you work
39FN42e41r0-1-rgb_front_00333|exhale as you pull up and you're going to feel that you really get to use your abdominals and your obliques as you go back and forth
39FN42e41r0-1-rgb_front_00334|ryan go ahead and get down
39FN42e41r0-1-rgb_front_00335|and ryan's going to do a one-handed renegade row
39FN42e41r0-1-rgb_front_00336|so basically he's just going to work one side at a time
39FN42e41r0-1-rgb_front_00337|the hand on the ground will give him a little more support and will make it a little easier
39FN42e41r0-1-rgb_front_00338|and then once he does five he's just going to switch over to the other side
39FN42e41r0-1-rgb_front_00339|again for this workout we're working for fifteen to twenty reps and another variation that i want you to work on or consider if you can do it is a push up renegade row like jonesy's doing here
39FN42e41r0-1-rgb_front_00340|each time you're going down you're going to do a push up and then come back up
39FN42e41r0-1-rgb_front_00341|it helps for a couple of different reasons it helps again to condition the chest but it also helps to stretch up--stretch out the anterior side of your shoulders which then allows you to get a deeper row
39FN42e41r0-1-rgb_front_00342|alright
39FN42e41r0-1-rgb_front_00343|good
39FN42e41r0-1-rgb_front_00344|and then once you've done with fifteen or twenty reps grab some water meet us on the next exercise in the next clip
3EjKvwck6ss-1-rgb_front_00345|now that we've blow dried and separated all the sub-sections what we're going to do is go ahead and start with our finishing products
3EjKvwck6ss-1-rgb_front_00346|what i like to do first is i like to heat the hair up just a little bit especially just on the ends
3EjKvwck6ss-1-rgb_front_00347|we're just going to heat up the hair
3EjKvwck6ss-1-rgb_front_00348|then what i like to do is go on with my fiber pliable paste
3EjKvwck6ss-1-rgb_front_00349|a lot of people ask me why do you use that product before you go ahead and finalize and finish it
3EjKvwck6ss-1-rgb_front_00350|i like to think about it as getting your car painted
3EjKvwck6ss-1-rgb_front_00351|do you know what they do before they paint your car
3EjKvwck6ss-1-rgb_front_00352|they prime it
3EjKvwck6ss-1-rgb_front_00353|basically what this is doing for me is priming your hair and getting it ready for that last shot of color
3EjKvwck6ss-1-rgb_front_00354|in this case hairspray
3EjKvwck6ss-1-rgb_front_00355|does it make the shine stay more
3EjKvwck6ss-1-rgb_front_00356|it does
3EjKvwck6ss-1-rgb_front_00357|basically what i do by heating up the hair and you'll notice when you put it in it kind of melts in your hair
3EjKvwck6ss-1-rgb_front_00358|it's like putting butter
3EjKvwck6ss-1-rgb_front_00359|when you heat up butter butter is going to spread better so basically that's what this is
3EjKvwck6ss-1-rgb_front_00360|it's like spreading butter
3EjKvwck6ss-1-rgb_front_00361|does it help with the dryness
3EjKvwck6ss-1-rgb_front_00362|it's not going to help with the dryness
3EjKvwck6ss-1-rgb_front_00363|the moisturizing conditioner is what's going to help with the dryness of your hair
3EjKvwck6ss-1-rgb_front_00364|what this is going to do is just help to keep its shape what we're going for
3EjKvwck6ss-1-rgb_front_00365|it's pliable and it's fibrous and it gives you some of that separation you want on your ends
3EjKvwck6ss-1-rgb_front_00366|heat it up in your palms and just pull it through
3EjKvwck6ss-1-rgb_front_00367|there we go
3EjKvwck6ss-1-rgb_front_00368|let's go ahead and go on to our next section
3HCjTYIijec-2-rgb_front_00369|urban legends are often the unwritten beliefs that people have and announce to others
3HCjTYIijec-2-rgb_front_00370|well what are the unwritten rules for women about dating
3HCjTYIijec-2-rgb_front_00371|this is dr paul author of boomer girls a boomer woman's guide to men and dating and host of ask dr paul
3HCjTYIijec-2-rgb_front_00372|if they're unwritten then how do we know them
3HCjTYIijec-2-rgb_front_00373|well they're passed on and the best thing i can say about unwritten rules is do not depend on another woman as a woman to give you valid information
3HCjTYIijec-2-rgb_front_00374|guess what ladies they're as equally involved with finding the answers as you are and they're not going to find them from asking you because you're also asking them
3HCjTYIijec-2-rgb_front_00375|it's a vicious cycle
3HCjTYIijec-2-rgb_front_00376|if you have questions as i often say if you want to find out about a man why ask a woman ask a man ask dr paul
3HCjTYIijec-2-rgb_front_00377|if you're at the point where you're asking your girlfriends for their opinions and their input then you're doing the wrong thing
3HCjTYIijec-2-rgb_front_00378|so the unwritten beliefs that you're going to get that data that you need from your girl friends is totally absolutely unequivocally wrong
3HCjTYIijec-2-rgb_front_00379|they're no more successful than you are the probability is you're more successful they may have their own agenda as well
3HCjTYIijec-2-rgb_front_00380|so i would say the first unwritten rule is do not depend on your girl friends to give you valid input for your choices
3HCjTYIijec-2-rgb_front_00381|that's what it's all about
3HCjTYIijec-2-rgb_front_00382|this is dr paul
3HCjTYIijec-2-rgb_front_00383|may your fantasies of today be your realities of tomorrow
3TrMyzNWGpY-2-rgb_front_00384|hi everybody i'm john graden from the martial arts teacher's association and johngradencom
3TrMyzNWGpY-2-rgb_front_00385|how do you practice your kickboxing moves
3TrMyzNWGpY-2-rgb_front_00386|that's a great question
3TrMyzNWGpY-2-rgb_front_00387|as a kickboxer this is one i'm particularly fond of
3TrMyzNWGpY-2-rgb_front_00388|here is a common mistake that people make when they are dong their kickboxing moves
3TrMyzNWGpY-2-rgb_front_00389|if i am hitting the bag or i'm doing the targets most beginners will try and power every single move
3TrMyzNWGpY-2-rgb_front_00390|they'll try and slam the bag every move and what happens when you do that is one you waste a lot of energy two you tense the body up three you tend to run out of gas faster
3TrMyzNWGpY-2-rgb_front_00391|you don't typically spar like that or fight like that in a match so you want to train like you fight in a match and how is that
3TrMyzNWGpY-2-rgb_front_00392|i'll have techniques that i'm just going to snap and i'm just going to pop out there so i might go snap snap snap snap snap and about every seventh or eight go pow pow pow pow pow and then i recover
3TrMyzNWGpY-2-rgb_front_00393|pow pow pow pow so i'm mixing my snapping my speed techniques with my power techniques two every time you step in and every time you throw a technique you want to make sure you're penetrating with your footwork and you are not standing in one spot digging a hole
3TrMyzNWGpY-2-rgb_front_00394|every time you throw your reverse move you always close the gap on your opponent come in engage and then clear step out re-open the gap with a clearing technique i like to clear with a jab or i'll clear with the front leg round kick
3TrMyzNWGpY-2-rgb_front_00395|so i engage step in fire fire fire clear and then here is the biggy change my alignment on the bag or the target and then repeat the process
3TrMyzNWGpY-2-rgb_front_00396|so we are mixing our snapping techniques not just doing power all the time two every attack penetrating footwork engage clearing footwork change your alignment that's always the pattern
3TrMyzNWGpY-2-rgb_front_00397|penetrate engage clear change your alignment penetrate engage clear change your alignment
3TrMyzNWGpY-2-rgb_front_00398|make sure that that is the pattern you are developing in the gym so that when you are in the ring that is how your fight comes out
3TrMyzNWGpY-2-rgb_front_00399|i'm john graden
3TrMyzNWGpY-2-rgb_front_00400|i hope that helps
3TrMyzNWGpY-2-rgb_front_00401|thanks very much
3sZjSNcqXpI-1-rgb_front_00402|now depending on your style of play if you like to play offense or defense you should be able to choose before you start the game where you want to go on the field
3sZjSNcqXpI-1-rgb_front_00403|if you're willing to play defense you should stay in the back where you can see the field clearly and be able to communicate with your teammates who move forward
3sZjSNcqXpI-1-rgb_front_00404|now if defense isn't your thing and you like to play more offense when you're playing up front be sure that you communicate with your teammate who is playing defense
3sZjSNcqXpI-1-rgb_front_00405|ask them where the teammates of the other team are so you can be able to be able not get shot at from an area where you're not looking
3sZjSNcqXpI-1-rgb_front_00406|if you're playing offense and you're up front make sure you're laying down as much fire as possible to keep the other team from not shooting at you
3xni-I6N3EY-1-rgb_front_00407|this medicine has been around for over 5000 years
3xni-I6N3EY-1-rgb_front_00408|before recorded history between 100 bc and 200 ad the yellow emperor's classic was written down so there was a huge amount of time when medicine was being practiced upon in the china continent and its fundamental principles all came back to the philosophies that were also moving across
3xni-I6N3EY-1-rgb_front_00409|you had observation as the key point
3xni-I6N3EY-1-rgb_front_00410|it was sacrilegious to dissect the human body so the systems of acupuncture acupressure as well as the use of herbs all came about through trial and error and they all came about through the constellations of the stars and the idea reflected of the micro and the macro so that points were developed for the purpose of releasing this natural flow of chi
3xni-I6N3EY-1-rgb_front_00411|in this next segment we will talk about the six external causes of illness
40JRPcYZkWg-1-rgb_front_00412|if you look out on the market you're going to find a lot of different types of equipment
40JRPcYZkWg-1-rgb_front_00413|the two big ones i want to talk about though right now are metal versus plastic
40JRPcYZkWg-1-rgb_front_00414|if you remember to make good biodiesel we need a lot of heat
40JRPcYZkWg-1-rgb_front_00415|typically if you find metal processors you're going to get better reaction simply because the heat is better
40JRPcYZkWg-1-rgb_front_00416|you also want to look for good mixing as well
40JRPcYZkWg-1-rgb_front_00417|also because we are dealing with a flammable substance methanol it's a little bit safer if you use metal tanks versus plastic tanks
40JRPcYZkWg-1-rgb_front_00418|also if you're heating within the tank you don't want your tank to melt on you so i kinda recommend metal tanks over plastic tanks
40JRPcYZkWg-1-rgb_front_00419|do your research look hard but look for the plastic look for the metal see which ones work the best for you
40JRPcYZkWg-1-rgb_front_00420|again calling it referrals but my feeling is you can make better biodiesel with metal tanks
46Cwjrd4ua4-2-rgb_front_00421|now the next environmental factors that you want to look at are the date and the year
46Cwjrd4ua4-2-rgb_front_00422|when does this take place
46Cwjrd4ua4-2-rgb_front_00423|is it 1912
46Cwjrd4ua4-2-rgb_front_00424|is it 1960's
46Cwjrd4ua4-2-rgb_front_00425|is it 2008
46Cwjrd4ua4-2-rgb_front_00426|is it in the future
46Cwjrd4ua4-2-rgb_front_00427|going to be real important to know what time period because people acted differently; the social norms were different in different time periods
46Cwjrd4ua4-2-rgb_front_00428|you also want to take a look at the season
46Cwjrd4ua4-2-rgb_front_00429|what time of year does this take place
46Cwjrd4ua4-2-rgb_front_00430|and it could change throughout the play or the movie but is it taking place in the winter
46Cwjrd4ua4-2-rgb_front_00431|is it taking place in the summer
46Cwjrd4ua4-2-rgb_front_00432|the fall
46Cwjrd4ua4-2-rgb_front_00433|the spring
46Cwjrd4ua4-2-rgb_front_00434|these are real important things because let's say it's taking place in new orleans in the summer
46Cwjrd4ua4-2-rgb_front_00435|well that means it's going to be hot and muggy and that's going to directly affect how your character's going to respond
46Cwjrd4ua4-2-rgb_front_00436|or is it taking place in north dakota in the winter where it's very very cold
46Cwjrd4ua4-2-rgb_front_00437|that will affect how your character reacts and responds and moves and so forth and so on
46Cwjrd4ua4-2-rgb_front_00438|you also need to take a look at the time period in the sense of how long does this whole interaction of this play or movie take place
46Cwjrd4ua4-2-rgb_front_00439|is it a day
46Cwjrd4ua4-2-rgb_front_00440|is it a week
46Cwjrd4ua4-2-rgb_front_00441|is it a month
46Cwjrd4ua4-2-rgb_front_00442|is it a year
46Cwjrd4ua4-2-rgb_front_00443|does everything usually take place in the morning or in the middle of the night or in the daytime
46Cwjrd4ua4-2-rgb_front_00444|all of those things can affect how your character acts
46Cwjrd4ua4-2-rgb_front_00445|also you also want to take into consideration the date
46Cwjrd4ua4-2-rgb_front_00446|meaning are there any specific holidays
46Cwjrd4ua4-2-rgb_front_00447|does this take place on a sunday
46Cwjrd4ua4-2-rgb_front_00448|what do people usually do on sunday
46Cwjrd4ua4-2-rgb_front_00449|does it take place on a monday
46Cwjrd4ua4-2-rgb_front_00450|what are people usually doing on a monday
46Cwjrd4ua4-2-rgb_front_00451|does it take place over st patrick's day or president's day or christmas
46Cwjrd4ua4-2-rgb_front_00452|take into effect all of those environmental factors
48Hj_AyP3Fk-2-rgb_front_00453|hello
48Hj_AyP3Fk-2-rgb_front_00454|my name is zephyr clarke-dolberg from miami dog training
48Hj_AyP3Fk-2-rgb_front_00455|in this clip we're going to teach you how to walk a dog
48Hj_AyP3Fk-2-rgb_front_00456|now number one is with the leash
48Hj_AyP3Fk-2-rgb_front_00457|sometimes you know people get confident over confident with their dogs off leash and you know something spooks a dog it sees a cat it runs out into the street and that can cause problems
48Hj_AyP3Fk-2-rgb_front_00458|so walking a dog number one should be done on the leash
48Hj_AyP3Fk-2-rgb_front_00459|preferably a five to six foot leash
48Hj_AyP3Fk-2-rgb_front_00460|i prefer a five foot leash
48Hj_AyP3Fk-2-rgb_front_00461|and a leather leash you know your tools are are your biggest asset when you're working with your dog or walking with your dog
48Hj_AyP3Fk-2-rgb_front_00462|so walking with your dog you always want to make sure that you are the leader you're in the front
48Hj_AyP3Fk-2-rgb_front_00463|so i'm going to ex ex show you an example of that right now
48Hj_AyP3Fk-2-rgb_front_00464|you notice she stays behind me
48Hj_AyP3Fk-2-rgb_front_00465|she's not advancing forward because she needs to read my body language to see what she should do next
48Hj_AyP3Fk-2-rgb_front_00466|she should be always looking for a cue from you
48Hj_AyP3Fk-2-rgb_front_00467|so and as you can see when i stop she sits and she's relaxed
48Hj_AyP3Fk-2-rgb_front_00468|so when you're walking your dog you always want to stay controlled
48Hj_AyP3Fk-2-rgb_front_00469|and always walk them on one side so they're not confused about going back and forth
48Hj_AyP3Fk-2-rgb_front_00470|this is zephyr clarke-dolberg and this has been how to walk a dog
48hXSSOwsNE-2-rgb_front_00471|on this segment we're going to talk about foot brush sets and combinations it's very important when you're setting your foot brushes to put it in the right spot
48hXSSOwsNE-2-rgb_front_00472|it makes it a lot easier to to complete the move
48hXSSOwsNE-2-rgb_front_00473|so you really want your your foot brushes to be right in front of you so when you go to set it up and kick it it's going to be right in your wheelhouse
48hXSSOwsNE-2-rgb_front_00474|so now the wind has changed directions a little bit so we're going to maybe go here
48hXSSOwsNE-2-rgb_front_00475|so i'm going to toss it to ryan; he's going to set it up for a foot brush for me
48hXSSOwsNE-2-rgb_front_00476|and if you notice it was right in the perfect spot right here off of his set to my foot brush
48hXSSOwsNE-2-rgb_front_00477|now if you want to do several different combinations where you're putting a couple of the foot brushes together you could toss it up kick it here toss it up here here here
48hXSSOwsNE-2-rgb_front_00478|so you can do tons of different combos
48hXSSOwsNE-2-rgb_front_00479|you can actually go there left foot and right foot
4CSSlWonj3E-2-rgb_front_00480|richard buccola: hi
4CSSlWonj3E-2-rgb_front_00481|all right we put our garlic in a bowl and now we're going to just cut up some celery as well
4CSSlWonj3E-2-rgb_front_00482|i'm just going to cut off the top end of that celery and what i want to do is just give it a good slice lengthwise and maybe another time lengthwise that's pretty good just them out them together and just start to cut tiny little pieces
4CSSlWonj3E-2-rgb_front_00483|i'm cutting these down i'm going to cut all the way through
4CSSlWonj3E-2-rgb_front_00484|we only need about a quarter cup of celery but i like to chop these down even finer
4CSSlWonj3E-2-rgb_front_00485|so what i'll do is then start again doing my chopping motion of my blade coming--the back of the blade coming up and down
4CSSlWonj3E-2-rgb_front_00486|all right i got these chopped real fine the way i want it so i'm just going to add it to my bowl and i'm going to then chop up our zucchini
4CSSlWonj3E-2-rgb_front_00487|we're just trying to chop up everything so it's all prepped; this is all our prep work right now
4CSSlWonj3E-2-rgb_front_00488|so come on back
4GG2H4QR9W8-2-rgb_front_00489|how you doing
4GG2H4QR9W8-2-rgb_front_00490|the first thing on this i'm going to do is show you how to pick out ingredients
4GG2H4QR9W8-2-rgb_front_00491|first of all you have the tomato the tomato needs to be nice and firm all the way around
4GG2H4QR9W8-2-rgb_front_00492|you want there to be no bruising or no big dents and you want it to be bright red
4GG2H4QR9W8-2-rgb_front_00493|the avocado for the guacamole now you want this avocado to be nice and tender
4GG2H4QR9W8-2-rgb_front_00494|you don't want it to be real hard or anything like that you want to be able to push this circle button on the very top to push that button in and if sinks in like that then that it is nice and firm in the inside
4GG2H4QR9W8-2-rgb_front_00495|you got your mango we want to make sure that your mango is pretty tender so if you push it down you can go in but you don't want it to be so soft where you thumb goes right through
4GG2H4QR9W8-2-rgb_front_00496|you want it to be kind of firm but at the same time you want it to be also tender
4GG2H4QR9W8-2-rgb_front_00497|same thing with your lime you want to see a nice tenderness going all the way around it and you want it to be bright green
4GG2H4QR9W8-2-rgb_front_00498|if you see any browning or it is kind of hard that means that it is a older lime and you don't want to go around that lime you want it to stay away from that
4GG2H4QR9W8-2-rgb_front_00499|with your serrano's you also want them to be bright green and just look around and make sure that there is no holes or bruising
4GG2H4QR9W8-2-rgb_front_00500|you onions are kind of hard to tell what your onions look likes because it has a wrap around it you just want to go around the onion and kind of feel and make sure there is no holes or anything like that and the same thing with the shallots
4GG2H4QR9W8-2-rgb_front_00501|you want to go around and make sure there is no holes and that is how you can pick ingredient for making this meal
4PKquZ1fUGk-2-rgb_front_00502|the first product that i'm going to talk to about is a product called egyptian magic
4PKquZ1fUGk-2-rgb_front_00503|this is one of my favorite things to use for hair skin lips soars everything
4PKquZ1fUGk-2-rgb_front_00504|it's great
4PKquZ1fUGk-2-rgb_front_00505|now when it comes to this product the best quality about it is that it's all natural ingredients
4PKquZ1fUGk-2-rgb_front_00506|as you can see it kind of starts out looking like a wax but when you dig some out you just stick it in your hand and then it melts slowly and turns into oil
4PKquZ1fUGk-2-rgb_front_00507|this makes it really easy to massage into a scalp and to run through somebodies hair this i really like to use in pretreatment
4PKquZ1fUGk-2-rgb_front_00508|if you rub a lot of this throughout the hair it's kind of like a leave in conditioner and it keeps it moisturized throughout the whole braiding process
4PKquZ1fUGk-2-rgb_front_00509|that way it doesn't dry out anytime in the middle but it's great for your skin
4PKquZ1fUGk-2-rgb_front_00510|also after braiding style is complete it's good to just take a little bit and run it in between each braid
4PKquZ1fUGk-2-rgb_front_00511|just to get that scalp extra happy and extra moisturized
4PKquZ1fUGk-2-rgb_front_00512|since it's just been pulled on for an extended amount of time
4VXvnpxTEEw-1-rgb_front_00513|in this next clip we're going to talk about wind chill and wind chill factors
4VXvnpxTEEw-1-rgb_front_00514|this is a critical consideration when you're dealing with the outdoors
4VXvnpxTEEw-1-rgb_front_00515|the wind chill and your dress
4VXvnpxTEEw-1-rgb_front_00516|you dress for wind chill not for the temperature that you have outside
4VXvnpxTEEw-1-rgb_front_00517|for instance right here since we been filming here for this clip a cloud came over and the temperature dropped ten degrees just in the last two minutes
4VXvnpxTEEw-1-rgb_front_00518|and the wind chill actually adds extra to that temperature drop
4VXvnpxTEEw-1-rgb_front_00519|so wind chill we'll take a look at this wind chill chart and i'll show you what kind of temperature drops you have even for a minor change in the wind
4VXvnpxTEEw-1-rgb_front_00520|on this wind chill chart you have the temperature across the top and then you have the wind speed along the sides
4VXvnpxTEEw-1-rgb_front_00521|and then you just cross reference your data and you'll come up with the actual real temperature real life temperature that you have to dress for
4VXvnpxTEEw-1-rgb_front_00522|a five degree shift in the wind will drop the actual real life temperature ten to fifteen degrees
4VXvnpxTEEw-1-rgb_front_00523|this wind chill chart is available from the noa weather and the national weather service as a free download from their website
4XgOVMG-zIo-1-rgb_front_00524|i'm going to show you how to make a bluebird
4XgOVMG-zIo-1-rgb_front_00525|now this drink is stirred and not shaken so you don't need much ice
4XgOVMG-zIo-1-rgb_front_00526|so take it put it in to your glass
4XgOVMG-zIo-1-rgb_front_00527|you're going to add an ounce and half of gin
4XgOVMG-zIo-1-rgb_front_00528|so get your jigger
4XgOVMG-zIo-1-rgb_front_00529|pour in an ounce flip it over and add the half of ounce
4XgOVMG-zIo-1-rgb_front_00530|then you're going to add an ounce of trip sec actually half an ounce of triple sec
4XgOVMG-zIo-1-rgb_front_00531|just grab that
4XgOVMG-zIo-1-rgb_front_00532|to the small side of the jigger
4XgOVMG-zIo-1-rgb_front_00533|you're going to do an half an ounce of blue curacao
4XgOVMG-zIo-1-rgb_front_00534|despite it's blue flavor it has an orange taste behind it
4XgOVMG-zIo-1-rgb_front_00535|then you're going to add a couple dashes of bitters so have that handy
4XgOVMG-zIo-1-rgb_front_00536|do just a couple
4XgOVMG-zIo-1-rgb_front_00537|that should be good
4XgOVMG-zIo-1-rgb_front_00538|and then you're going to stir it so have your stirrer available
4XgOVMG-zIo-1-rgb_front_00539|put it in and twist it around just like that
4XgOVMG-zIo-1-rgb_front_00540|looks good
4XgOVMG-zIo-1-rgb_front_00541|then you're going to strain it in to a glass
4XgOVMG-zIo-1-rgb_front_00542|so grab your glass have your stainer available and gently pout it in
4XgOVMG-zIo-1-rgb_front_00543|just like so
4XgOVMG-zIo-1-rgb_front_00544|and you're going to garnish this with a cherry and a lemon twist that you can twist
4XgOVMG-zIo-1-rgb_front_00545|pour in just like that put in your straw and then you have a blue bird
4XlVMRXLydg-5-rgb_front_00546|we're going to do gathering chi from heaven and earth
4XlVMRXLydg-5-rgb_front_00547|and i want you to if you'd like to follow along with me that'd be great
4XlVMRXLydg-5-rgb_front_00548|but gathering chi from heaven and earth one of the great things about qigung is that the movements can be very very simple
4XlVMRXLydg-5-rgb_front_00549|we don't have to do any complex movements here
4XlVMRXLydg-5-rgb_front_00550|there are complex movements later on in higher levels of qigung
4XlVMRXLydg-5-rgb_front_00551|but the wonderful thing about qigung is that quigung can be done with any age group
4XlVMRXLydg-5-rgb_front_00552|any age group
4XlVMRXLydg-5-rgb_front_00553|we have movements in qigung that eighty year olds can do ninety year olds can do
4XlVMRXLydg-5-rgb_front_00554|we have movements in quigung that require stronger flexibility more endurance and so on
4XlVMRXLydg-5-rgb_front_00555|but the point to this is that when you do qigung you can do so many different movements
4XlVMRXLydg-5-rgb_front_00556|there are so many movements in qigung that when you learn a great amount of qigung you could pick what you would like to do what your body can handle
4XlVMRXLydg-5-rgb_front_00557|ok
4XlVMRXLydg-5-rgb_front_00558|and a real simple one is gathering chi from heaven and earth
4XlVMRXLydg-5-rgb_front_00559|and what i'd like to do is demonstrate the form for you and kind of just talk through the form as you're watching me do this
4XlVMRXLydg-5-rgb_front_00560|so we always want to start out in the wu chi posture
4XlVMRXLydg-5-rgb_front_00561|right -- first one always stand in the wu chi posture
4XlVMRXLydg-5-rgb_front_00562|work your way from the feet up to the top of the head
4XlVMRXLydg-5-rgb_front_00563|once you do that then you go to your breathing
4XlVMRXLydg-5-rgb_front_00564|inhale exhale
4XlVMRXLydg-5-rgb_front_00565|ok
4XlVMRXLydg-5-rgb_front_00566|from here once you have a feeling of peace and focus that the mind isn't racing around anymore that you're very calm and relaxed let's begin the movement then
4XlVMRXLydg-5-rgb_front_00567|then begin the posture and the movement is what we're going to do which is gathering chi from heaven and earth
5Gw0TpbCMTQ-5-rgb_front_00568|hi my name's floyd i'm talking to you today from theacousticmusiciancom in sandy utah and we're going to talk about how to read guitar music today
5Gw0TpbCMTQ-5-rgb_front_00569|the most common form of guitar music that is used nowadays is called tablature
5Gw0TpbCMTQ-5-rgb_front_00570|and that is this line here and what it is is each one of the lines here represents the strings on the guitar
5Gw0TpbCMTQ-5-rgb_front_00571|this would be your high e this would be your low e and this shows which fret or the position on the guitar that you would play
5Gw0TpbCMTQ-5-rgb_front_00572|now the line up here is standard notation which a lot of people don't know how to read
5Gw0TpbCMTQ-5-rgb_front_00573|but this just shows finger position and note placement on the strings to be able to play the guitar
5RR7dlzkyL0-5-rgb_front_00574|now first of all i want to tell you when you are doing business over the phone you automatically lose a huge part of your ability to communicate
5RR7dlzkyL0-5-rgb_front_00575|and what i'm talking about is no longer do you have any non-verbalâs to work with
5RR7dlzkyL0-5-rgb_front_00576|whoever's on the other end of that phone they can't see your face they can't see your body they can't read what you're doing or what's in your environment
5RR7dlzkyL0-5-rgb_front_00577|so basically all you're left with is your tone of voice
5RR7dlzkyL0-5-rgb_front_00578|your attitude which comes through in your tone of voice and this is what you have to work with
5RR7dlzkyL0-5-rgb_front_00579|this is what will convey your professionalism
5RR7dlzkyL0-5-rgb_front_00580|this is what will convey your willingness to listen and to help and to be a professional
5RR7dlzkyL0-5-rgb_front_00581|so it's very important that we focus on the specifics of working with such few things
BL4ZqiUZO1U-5-rgb_front_00582|minimum 1x3 counter battens are run vertical and centered over existing rafters
BL4ZqiUZO1U-5-rgb_front_00583|a moisture membrane of felt tri flex or ice and water shield is placed horizontally with proper lap to allow the membrane to loop over the counter battens
BL4ZqiUZO1U-5-rgb_front_00584|the main framing and details are then continued
BL4ZqiUZO1U-5-rgb_front_00585|care must be taken to protect the membrane from penetrations
BL4ZqiUZO1U-5-rgb_front_00586|all cuts and penetrations should be sealed with tape
BL4ZqiUZO1U-5-rgb_front_00587|in a situation where you work from the top down or where there is a back set fascia you will need to telescope the lowest course under the next full course of tiles
BL4ZqiUZO1U-5-rgb_front_00588|in order to hold the panels in plain you will need to install a filler strip to support the back of the first course in lieu of the batten usually a 1 inch wide board will suffice
BMXB5nth8hA-5-rgb_front_00589|i'm with the kelly white team and today we're going to tell you how to buy a house
BMXB5nth8hA-5-rgb_front_00590|the prequalification letter; it's very very important for so many reasons
BMXB5nth8hA-5-rgb_front_00591|a prequalitfication letter is you're going to meet with a mortgage broker and the mortgage broker is going to run all your numbers find your credit score and everything
BMXB5nth8hA-5-rgb_front_00592|it's going to find out how much that bank can lend you
BMXB5nth8hA-5-rgb_front_00593|because this is important you're not really buying the house the bank is buying the house
BMXB5nth8hA-5-rgb_front_00594|the bank is loaning you the money to buy that house
BMXB5nth8hA-5-rgb_front_00595|this is a a prequalification letter
BMXB5nth8hA-5-rgb_front_00596|the reason it's important is first of all we find out how much you can spend
BMXB5nth8hA-5-rgb_front_00597|sometimes it's a pleasant surprise; sometimes it's oh my god
BMXB5nth8hA-5-rgb_front_00598|but most of the time it's a pleasant surprise
BMXB5nth8hA-5-rgb_front_00599|what we do with that prequalification letter when time comes to present the offer we always include the prequalification letter for 2 reasons
BMXB5nth8hA-5-rgb_front_00600|first of all it shows the seller that you are serious and it shows the realtor that you do have that money to purchase that house
BMXB5nth8hA-5-rgb_front_00601|a prequalification is really important
BZqXT5UYUD8-5-rgb_front_00602|it's really easy to do you can forward a call from your home phone to your cell to your office to your neighbor all you need to do is make sure you've got the number that your phone company has allocated to you
BZqXT5UYUD8-5-rgb_front_00603|in my case it's 73
BZqXT5UYUD8-5-rgb_front_00604|i hit *73 here a message it tells me what to do
BZqXT5UYUD8-5-rgb_front_00605|generally i would put in the number that the call is meant to be forwarded to and then automatically it happens i don't think about it
BZqXT5UYUD8-5-rgb_front_00606|hang up walk away it happens
BZqXT5UYUD8-5-rgb_front_00607|the easiest thing to do is just make sure that you keep track of the number that you've used so that you can undo it
BZqXT5UYUD8-5-rgb_front_00608|because when you come home you want to get the calls back to your phone you hit another number and in my case *73
BZqXT5UYUD8-5-rgb_front_00609|listen and it will undo that call forwarding
BZqXT5UYUD8-5-rgb_front_00610|each phone company will have a different sequence of numbers
BZqXT5UYUD8-5-rgb_front_00611|so make sure you check that before you start take advantage of that facility
BZqXT5UYUD8-5-rgb_front_00612|but call forwarding is a really really great tool for home or for business

BtG-2TZ5Cnk-5-rgb_front_00614|once again this is something that we we don't sell a whole lot of these days but we still would like for you to know a little bit about it just in case any of you all out there still use chlorine
BtG-2TZ5Cnk-5-rgb_front_00615|this this is a very good way of being able to test the level of chlorine that you have in your water
BtG-2TZ5Cnk-5-rgb_front_00616|so with that being said that's just a little bit about chlorine test papers
C0fPZgeY2rg-5-rgb_front_00617|how does a snake grow
C0fPZgeY2rg-5-rgb_front_00618|well that's a good question
C0fPZgeY2rg-5-rgb_front_00619|snakes grow in a kind of different way than we do
C0fPZgeY2rg-5-rgb_front_00620|people shed skin every day all day as they grow and change and move around
C0fPZgeY2rg-5-rgb_front_00621|snake scales are a little different they are more like an armor coating on the outside they don't allow for such free growth so what actually happens is they shed their skin like right down here we have shed skin from a baby corn snake well not really too much of a baby any more
C0fPZgeY2rg-5-rgb_front_00622|what they do is they rub their head against something here's the head over here
C0fPZgeY2rg-5-rgb_front_00623|they rub their head to split their skin and then slowly roll it off of them kind of like taking off a sock from the top down until this is actually inside out
C0fPZgeY2rg-5-rgb_front_00624|when it comes off of them and it is inside out
C0fPZgeY2rg-5-rgb_front_00625|then you can actually see all the little individual scales on the top and you can see all of the belly scales on the bottom and they do this depending on the size of the snake
C0fPZgeY2rg-5-rgb_front_00626|a baby snake might shed every week to an adult snake that might shed once a year so it really varies as to how often they're going to shed their skin because it depends on how much they are growing
C0fPZgeY2rg-5-rgb_front_00627|obviously an adult snake grows a lot less than a baby snake so they are going to shed a lot less but they do need to shed every once in a while to revitalize their scales repair any damage that may have occurred and continue on with their healthy life
C4lsh3mZ4jU-5-rgb_front_00628|hi
C4lsh3mZ4jU-5-rgb_front_00629|now i am going to show you how to repair a rip with a blind stitch
C4lsh3mZ4jU-5-rgb_front_00630|okay here is our rip and if you are doing a repair you want to match the thread color to the color of the garment
C4lsh3mZ4jU-5-rgb_front_00631|match as closely as possible but for purposes of showing you so that you can exactly what i am doing and what the stitch looks like i am going to use black thread
C4lsh3mZ4jU-5-rgb_front_00632|that should make it easier for you to see this
C4lsh3mZ4jU-5-rgb_front_00633|you want to knot your thread like i showed you; nice good knot and we are going to come up from the back of the garment about half an inch from the start of the rip
C4lsh3mZ4jU-5-rgb_front_00634|you are going to come up from the back to the front of the fabric and then you are going to make the needle go back in just a very small amount like a centimeter and take with the needle only less than a quarter inch probably eighth of inch of fabric and pull very loosely and then you will go on the opposite side of it; where you came out you go in and take again about somewhere between a quarter and eighth of fabric like this and then you go directly down from it again and but a little bit wider
C4lsh3mZ4jU-5-rgb_front_00635|you are going to start very small and close and a little wider a little wider and you will see what we are going to get
C4lsh3mZ4jU-5-rgb_front_00636|there you go now your stitches start off small bigger bigger and they are straight up and down perpendicular to the rip; about an eighth of an inch and go in down here
C4lsh3mZ4jU-5-rgb_front_00637|now we are up to where the rip begins and we are going to be sewing again just about somewhere between a quarter and eighth of an inch stitches and now we are going to go across the rip and enter here again
C4lsh3mZ4jU-5-rgb_front_00638|just about eighth of an inch away from the edge of the rip
C4lsh3mZ4jU-5-rgb_front_00639|as long as the material isn't fraying and you can put the needle in and it won't be coming out there
C4lsh3mZ4jU-5-rgb_front_00640|you pull that through
C4lsh3mZ4jU-5-rgb_front_00641|see how the stitches are coming perpendicular to the rip and let me get a few more and i will show you what to do
C4lsh3mZ4jU-5-rgb_front_00642|okay so then once we get a bunch f those we are going to pull very gently and see how it pulls that rip right together
C4lsh3mZ4jU-5-rgb_front_00643|it almost looks ike a seam
C4lsh3mZ4jU-5-rgb_front_00644|so the smaller the stitches the more delicate the repair will be
C6fVNI9QLYU-5-rgb_front_00645|you can't see it so i don't know what to explain it it's not a box blade so whatever when you have it at an angle whatever whatever catches on this side is gonna ride down and gonna run out that side so you're gonna have you'll have stock piled down at the end
C6fVNI9QLYU-5-rgb_front_00646|it doesn't gather it up on both side and bring it through
C6fVNI9QLYU-5-rgb_front_00647|it'll catch snow and push it over to the side of the road or it will catch dirt out of a high spot and move it over to the side
C6fVNI9QLYU-5-rgb_front_00648|but this unlike the box blade is not boxed in so whatever catches on the front side will roll down the blade and it will eventually go over to the side
C6fVNI9QLYU-5-rgb_front_00649|and you want that for snow removal or just to get something out of the way because you want to get it out of the road off to the side of the road and that's what this kind of blade would be for
C9ordUxwOEQ-5-rgb_front_00650|this is a tire pressure gauge
C9ordUxwOEQ-5-rgb_front_00651|you check the pressure of the tires and to change tire pressures every time you come in depending on track conditions the track continues to change every single time you go out there
C9ordUxwOEQ-5-rgb_front_00652|this is really easy to use its got a number gauge on it
C9ordUxwOEQ-5-rgb_front_00653|you just hook it up into this valve and it will show you a read
C9ordUxwOEQ-5-rgb_front_00654|you just read the ticks and you adjust the higher pressure with this little button and it just lets air out of the tire
C9ordUxwOEQ-5-rgb_front_00655|its really easy to use
C9ordUxwOEQ-5-rgb_front_00656|you can put air pressure in the tires by an air tank that is pressurized the same thing but this is putting pressure in the tire instead of out
C9ordUxwOEQ-5-rgb_front_00657|it depends on how much the track is changing but most times its only one or two psi your taking in or out of the tire
CFRh_KOT9nY-5-rgb_front_00658|hi this is jon and in this clip we'll be talking about the portable shop table
CFRh_KOT9nY-5-rgb_front_00659|as you begin to accessorize your wood shop you might also want to think about purchasing a portable shop table
CFRh_KOT9nY-5-rgb_front_00660|you'll notice on one side there are wheels at the base of each of the legs and at the other side we just have our standard feet
CFRh_KOT9nY-5-rgb_front_00661|now as you work on your projects around your shop you'll need to move them from station to station so at this table you'll just lift up on one end and you can easily wheel it to the next station maybe you're going to a table saw or a planer
CFRh_KOT9nY-5-rgb_front_00662|now some of these tables have handles built into them to make them a little bit more ergonomic and comfortable or if you're looking for more of a custom mobile workbench you can always go on line and search for free mobile workbench plans and that should bring up several different plans that you can build yourself
CFRh_KOT9nY-5-rgb_front_00663|now you'll notice that our workbench here in the shop is made of metal
CFRh_KOT9nY-5-rgb_front_00664|now if the surface gets scratched it will scratch your lumber so if you're building one or even if you purchase a metal one you might want to think about putting a wooden top on it so that if it does get scratched you could refinish it and make it smooth again
CO6qyvvglAE-5-rgb_front_00665|and now we're going to talk about some inputs that you can run through your board
CO6qyvvglAE-5-rgb_front_00666|here we have the denon dnc635 cd player
CO6qyvvglAE-5-rgb_front_00667|has many features
CO6qyvvglAE-5-rgb_front_00668|some of which aren't fantastically useful
CO6qyvvglAE-5-rgb_front_00669|let's play some music here
CO6qyvvglAE-5-rgb_front_00670|ok
CO6qyvvglAE-5-rgb_front_00671|so it has your basic cd player features
CO6qyvvglAE-5-rgb_front_00672|stop obviously duh
CO6qyvvglAE-5-rgb_front_00673|play woohoo
CO6qyvvglAE-5-rgb_front_00674|and you know pause no surprise there
CO6qyvvglAE-5-rgb_front_00675|important things you need to know about the denon player is when you want to change tracks you use this button that's called push and you turn it sideways
CO6qyvvglAE-5-rgb_front_00676|don't push it turn it sideways
CO6qyvvglAE-5-rgb_front_00677|and you can see the track numbers is advancing
CO6qyvvglAE-5-rgb_front_00678|one two three
CO6qyvvglAE-5-rgb_front_00679|ok
CO6qyvvglAE-5-rgb_front_00680|so there we go
CO6qyvvglAE-5-rgb_front_00681|that's how you change tracks
CO6qyvvglAE-5-rgb_front_00682|and when you're ready to play hit play obviously
CO6qyvvglAE-5-rgb_front_00683|now a great feature of the denon cd player is if you decide this is the track you want instead of hitting pause which just pauses it or hitting stop which actually would bring you back to track one you can hit go find the track you want again track three in this case
CO6qyvvglAE-5-rgb_front_00684|hit play
CO6qyvvglAE-5-rgb_front_00685|yes that's what i want
CO6qyvvglAE-5-rgb_front_00686|and then you hit the cue button and what that does is is it brings you back to the beginning of track three
CO6qyvvglAE-5-rgb_front_00687|so find your track with the turning this button that says push on it paradoxically
CO6qyvvglAE-5-rgb_front_00688|and then use cue to go to the beginning of the track you want to play
CSxgJLYMLZ4-5-rgb_front_00689|another very good use although a slightly more risky use of a wading wedge is carrying a backboard in a cross moving current
CSxgJLYMLZ4-5-rgb_front_00690|now while you should attempt to put the backboard in a raft or in something a lot more stationery and steady than a wade this is a last resort so you can use it
CSxgJLYMLZ4-5-rgb_front_00691|you need a lot of people the three people to create the wedge at the front and then a number of people down each side of the backboard where it's positioned in the middle
CSxgJLYMLZ4-5-rgb_front_00692|the head should be at the front so that way if the feet get dropped into the water the water will tend to plane the backboard up to the surface of the water
CSxgJLYMLZ4-5-rgb_front_00693|now at all times during this wade you need one person who is designated to maintaining the airway of whoever is on the backboard
CSxgJLYMLZ4-5-rgb_front_00694|if at any time the backboard drops into the water you've created a very bad situation because that person is trapped on the board
CSxgJLYMLZ4-5-rgb_front_00695|if you have the opportunity to do this that person should be facing down stream over them in a better position to maintain their airway
CzkLI34HFIg-5-rgb_front_00696|so i'm going to take these pants over and go ahead and press them down
CzkLI34HFIg-5-rgb_front_00697|and i'm going to show you how we're going to mark where we're going to cut off the pants
CzkLI34HFIg-5-rgb_front_00698|so let's go over here to my work table/ironing table and here we go
CzkLI34HFIg-5-rgb_front_00699|so the first thing i want to do is go ahead and iron this down just like i did the other leg just kind of pull it a tiny bit there we go
CzkLI34HFIg-5-rgb_front_00700|i'm just going to iron right here along the seam
CzkLI34HFIg-5-rgb_front_00701|and like i said before i like do that just because i know the fabric is right were it's supposed to be and you give it that little press
CzkLI34HFIg-5-rgb_front_00702|now this side okay
CzkLI34HFIg-5-rgb_front_00703|then we're going to open it and get that crease that i put there out
CzkLI34HFIg-5-rgb_front_00704|i'm going to do the inside also
CzkLI34HFIg-5-rgb_front_00705|okay because we've already done this once so i'm just going to get after and do it
CzkLI34HFIg-5-rgb_front_00706|okay so now that i have this pressed down i'm going to go ahead and flip these pants back out because i need to see that excess fabric so i can determine where i'm going to cut it off
CzkLI34HFIg-5-rgb_front_00707|okay here we go
CzkLI34HFIg-5-rgb_front_00708|and when i do this if i have to cut off the fabric i like to leave about an inch excess fabric in the inside
CzkLI34HFIg-5-rgb_front_00709|and that's a good idea just in case say someone else wants to wear them they'll have a little bit to work with
CzkLI34HFIg-5-rgb_front_00710|if they need to let the hem out because you can still let the pants out and still have some original hem left
CzkLI34HFIg-5-rgb_front_00711|so i'm just going to start right here where i put that one little seam that i sewed myself and mark 1 inch
CzkLI34HFIg-5-rgb_front_00712|here we go
CzkLI34HFIg-5-rgb_front_00713|and on this side and also on the next side
CzkLI34HFIg-5-rgb_front_00714|okay it's all the way around
CzkLI34HFIg-5-rgb_front_00715|so in a minute i'm going to show you how i'm going to talk about it and show you how we're going to trim this off
CzkLI34HFIg-5-rgb_front_00716|and i'll show you how to do that next
D4NatJnEMBU-5-rgb_front_00717|okay sausage today we're going to do a creole shrimp sausage the thing about creole and cajun cooking or sausage making is that they stuff about anything
D4NatJnEMBU-5-rgb_front_00718|into the casings and the sausage of you can do rabbit you can do goose you can do chicken turkey catfish i mean basically anything
D4NatJnEMBU-5-rgb_front_00719|the trick is to figure out the right seasonings that goes well with those meats that you use for that sausage
D4NatJnEMBU-5-rgb_front_00720|today what were going to do is a shrimp creole shrimp sausage it's going to be kind of spicy and were going to use some pork to actually bine that together
D4NatJnEMBU-5-rgb_front_00721|another option would be to eliminate the pork and you can actually use egg whites to create that bite
D4NatJnEMBU-5-rgb_front_00722|for this recipe were going to use a little bit of pork and shrimp to make our fillings so let's get started
DEdVsXBut4I-5-rgb_front_00723|ace 2 suited ace 3 suited; this is pretty much the best omaha high low hand because what it gives you gives you the aces you can win the high if you catch another ace or two
DEdVsXBut4I-5-rgb_front_00724|it gives you suited ace 2 and suited ace 3
DEdVsXBut4I-5-rgb_front_00725|with these you can pick up a high of a straight you can pick up a high of a flush and you can pick up a high of a straight flush
DEdVsXBut4I-5-rgb_front_00726|so you have a number of ways to win a high and also you have a number of ways to win the low
DEdVsXBut4I-5-rgb_front_00727|what does that mean visually
DEdVsXBut4I-5-rgb_front_00728|well let's take a look at this board here that i laid out
DEdVsXBut4I-5-rgb_front_00729|we got a board of jack 10 8 3 and 5 and our opponent has played a rather another and for omaha high low
DEdVsXBut4I-5-rgb_front_00730|but played it none the less and managed to draw out on us and catch the high of a straight to a queen
DEdVsXBut4I-5-rgb_front_00731|at last he does not win the low with his 5-2 and he doesn't even qualify for a low because he matches the 5
DEdVsXBut4I-5-rgb_front_00732|we on the other hand have a low hand we have 8 5 3 deuce ace so we would win half of the pot
DKJtnSrjIro-5-rgb_front_00733|so we have the bottom prepared and we've got our little bowl that has the pedestal and this is set up as well
DKJtnSrjIro-5-rgb_front_00734|it also is leather hard
DKJtnSrjIro-5-rgb_front_00735|now as you can see when i set it on there it's a little too big
DKJtnSrjIro-5-rgb_front_00736|it doesn't quite slip into that pedestal
DKJtnSrjIro-5-rgb_front_00737|so i have to trim this as well
DKJtnSrjIro-5-rgb_front_00738|so what i need to do in order to trim this first you want to get the wheel head wet
DKJtnSrjIro-5-rgb_front_00739|this is important because i just use suction to hold my pieces to the wheel
DKJtnSrjIro-5-rgb_front_00740|and that's going to happen because when i put this wet lip against this wet piece and i'm going to drop it kind of hard
DKJtnSrjIro-5-rgb_front_00741|and now it's sucked on there
DKJtnSrjIro-5-rgb_front_00742|i'm hitting and it's not moving
DKJtnSrjIro-5-rgb_front_00743|so again i'm going to spin it and i'm going to tap it on center
DKJtnSrjIro-5-rgb_front_00744|and press down in the middle you notice it slid at first that was the suction releasing
DKJtnSrjIro-5-rgb_front_00745|you press down in the middle and that recreates that suction
DKJtnSrjIro-5-rgb_front_00746|so it's important that this is hard enough before you start trimming that you can actually give some good pressure there in the center
DKJtnSrjIro-5-rgb_front_00747|and next we'll trim it
DKOzSnHwSFI-5-rgb_front_00748|hi my name is dave schoeneck and we're talking about how you're going to feel after your first day of adaptive skiing
DKOzSnHwSFI-5-rgb_front_00749|in some of the things to prepare would be obviously some upper body stretching
DKOzSnHwSFI-5-rgb_front_00750|upper body and abdominal exercises
DKOzSnHwSFI-5-rgb_front_00751|that always helps in preparation but after the first day you might be a little sore
DKOzSnHwSFI-5-rgb_front_00752|you probably will use muscles that you haven't used before but with that soreness will come a tremendous amount of exuberance and having fun
DKOzSnHwSFI-5-rgb_front_00753|at having being out on the mountain and just you wont be able to wait until you can get back up and ski again
DKOzSnHwSFI-5-rgb_front_00754|but again the more and more you can prepare any of your upper body muscles and with weights and stretching the better off you're going to be
DKOzSnHwSFI-5-rgb_front_00755|some of the muscles that you'll use would be obviously your forearms your biceps your lats your back
DKOzSnHwSFI-5-rgb_front_00756|there'll be a number of things you will can't find muscles that you didn't forgot you even had but those are really the upper body is doing a awful lot of the work for you and then you just let the ski do the rest of the work
DKOzSnHwSFI-5-rgb_front_00757|so but again the biggest thing that you're going to think about after your first day is not the aching muscles
DKOzSnHwSFI-5-rgb_front_00758|it's going to be how much fun you had and you just wont be able to wait until you get back up and do it again
DdzxfgB4W2c-5-rgb_front_00759|okay
DdzxfgB4W2c-5-rgb_front_00760|our fish has been in the oven for about 20 minutes so now it's time to take it out
DdzxfgB4W2c-5-rgb_front_00761|you can see the garlic is still in there and here's our fish packet
DdzxfgB4W2c-5-rgb_front_00762|yum
DdzxfgB4W2c-5-rgb_front_00763|the garlic still needs to cook
DdzxfgB4W2c-5-rgb_front_00764|here we go
DdzxfgB4W2c-5-rgb_front_00765|now we're just going to let this sit here and do what i like to call residual cooking
DdzxfgB4W2c-5-rgb_front_00766|actually all meats do that when you take them out of the heat the heat that's in there continues to cook the meat
DdzxfgB4W2c-5-rgb_front_00767|and that's what's going to keep it really moist and incredibly delicious texture soft texture
DdzxfgB4W2c-5-rgb_front_00768|so meanwhile let's just quickly do our broccoli
DdzxfgB4W2c-5-rgb_front_00769|this is -- we're just going take our knife and the broccoli and just cut the ends off of our florets like so
DdzxfgB4W2c-5-rgb_front_00770|just enough for two people is what we need to do
DdzxfgB4W2c-5-rgb_front_00771|and if you have more than two people you're welcome to save these stems and eat them too if you'd like
DdzxfgB4W2c-5-rgb_front_00772|i happen to prefer just the broccoli florets
DdzxfgB4W2c-5-rgb_front_00773|and to this we're going to go over to the sink so we can put an inch of water
DdzxfgB4W2c-5-rgb_front_00774|we just need a little bit of water in here at the bottom -- just a little bit of water
DdzxfgB4W2c-5-rgb_front_00775|and i'm going to put the broccoli florets in here like so
DdzxfgB4W2c-5-rgb_front_00776|i'm going to cover them and i'm going to put them on the stove -- here we go -- and i'm going to boil them with high heat
DdzxfgB4W2c-5-rgb_front_00777|so just that little bit of water is really going to be more like steaming so it's not going to be overcooked so it's going to be a bright green
DdzxfgB4W2c-5-rgb_front_00778|and i'm going to check them every once in a while but it takes about 10 minutes to cook
DdzxfgB4W2c-5-rgb_front_00779|so keep clicking we're getting close to putting it all together
DfnHNkTE7mE-5-rgb_front_00780|i got my first job back in 1984 on a tv series called miami vice
DfnHNkTE7mE-5-rgb_front_00781|they were down in miami filming locally of course where the series was shot
DfnHNkTE7mE-5-rgb_front_00782|and a call came out to all the actors aspiring actors in the area that a casting director was looking for people that had skill and were comfortable in front of a camera to work on a tv show called miami vice
DfnHNkTE7mE-5-rgb_front_00783|so i went in not knowing what to expect really you know
DfnHNkTE7mE-5-rgb_front_00784|this was my first introduction to it and i got sides
DfnHNkTE7mE-5-rgb_front_00785|and i was told you know memorize these sides or look at them and then come back in and i'm going to put you on camera doing this
DfnHNkTE7mE-5-rgb_front_00786|so i did that and they liked me
DfnHNkTE7mE-5-rgb_front_00787|and i got hired as an actor on miami vice
DfnHNkTE7mE-5-rgb_front_00788|that was my first job
DfnHNkTE7mE-5-rgb_front_00789|and i was playing a russian kgb agent
DfnHNkTE7mE-5-rgb_front_00790|i think i was a little bit thinner a lot thinner then and i had really high cheekbones and because of the way i looked somehow i had a russian look to me
DfnHNkTE7mE-5-rgb_front_00791|and the director who happened to be eddie olmos who played capt castillo on the series he saw my face and said strong face great bones
DfnHNkTE7mE-5-rgb_front_00792|looks russian to me
DfnHNkTE7mE-5-rgb_front_00793|let's put him in the suit so to speak
DfnHNkTE7mE-5-rgb_front_00794|so i was an ex-kgb guy running around trying to kill crockett and tubbs with a machine gun for most of the show
DfnHNkTE7mE-5-rgb_front_00795|i think the biggest break for me working in film was being associated with a real high quality project
DfnHNkTE7mE-5-rgb_front_00796|i did monster with charlize theron in 2004
DfnHNkTE7mE-5-rgb_front_00797|and it was a little independent movie
DfnHNkTE7mE-5-rgb_front_00798|it was actually lower that the screen actors guild's standard and we all got a low budget pay for it
DfnHNkTE7mE-5-rgb_front_00799|but you know that's the great thing about this business you never know where or how the project you're taking might develop or create a buzz or get elevated you know as some films do
DfnHNkTE7mE-5-rgb_front_00800|and for her it got her an academy award
DfnHNkTE7mE-5-rgb_front_00801|so i was in a scene with charlize theron in monster
DfnHNkTE7mE-5-rgb_front_00802|and during the course of all the accolades and awards that she received for that i think that it was either the screen actors guild award show which was telecast on tnt or something turner's broadcasting who showed that she mentioned my name
DfnHNkTE7mE-5-rgb_front_00803|she thanked me
DfnHNkTE7mE-5-rgb_front_00804|and i only worked one night with her
DfnHNkTE7mE-5-rgb_front_00805|we had a long scene to do
DfnHNkTE7mE-5-rgb_front_00806|i remember it being very cold and i was very bloody and in my underwear which makes you wonder wow i've got to go back and rent that now
DfnHNkTE7mE-5-rgb_front_00807|so yeah do that go rent it because residuals also help us actors and anything you can do to help me i'd appreciate it
DfnHNkTE7mE-5-rgb_front_00808|so go rent the movie and check out the scene
DwlVtUKfv3s-5-rgb_front_00809|as you are getting ready for the ball to come over the net and to hit it it's important that you're moving side to side and then bouncing on the balls of your feet
DwlVtUKfv3s-5-rgb_front_00810|you should never just stay put
DwlVtUKfv3s-5-rgb_front_00811|you should be moving because that's going to give you the energy to get the ball
DwlVtUKfv3s-5-rgb_front_00812|you should have your knees bent your feet spread out moving side to side
DwlVtUKfv3s-5-rgb_front_00813|then your back should be angled so that you are ready to move
DwlVtUKfv3s-5-rgb_front_00814|if you were leaning back like this it's going to be harder to get up to go get the ball
DwlVtUKfv3s-5-rgb_front_00815|so when it's all working right you're going to have your feet moving all the time your hands and your racket moving side to side your shoulders your eyes following the ball
EQWFrWeRVjQ-3-rgb_front_00816|and today we're going to learn how to set up a drum kit
EQWFrWeRVjQ-3-rgb_front_00817|so now that all the drums are set up and we've set up our hi-hat stand we're going to set up our first crash cymbal stand
EQWFrWeRVjQ-3-rgb_front_00818|same concept loosen the wing nut and spread the legs to a nice sturdy situation
EQWFrWeRVjQ-3-rgb_front_00819|and we're going to tighten it up
EQWFrWeRVjQ-3-rgb_front_00820|now what you want to do here - this is kind of important - you want to take this first leg or one leg and you want to put it facing the inside of your drum set or facing where you're going to be sitting because when you hit it from that angle you don't want it to tip over
EQWFrWeRVjQ-3-rgb_front_00821|see if you'd hit it from here there's a possibility that it could tip
EQWFrWeRVjQ-3-rgb_front_00822|so we set it there
EQWFrWeRVjQ-3-rgb_front_00823|that's a good place right now for it
EQWFrWeRVjQ-3-rgb_front_00824|and now we have to extend it
EQWFrWeRVjQ-3-rgb_front_00825|so we can take this loosen it and we're going to tighten that
EQWFrWeRVjQ-3-rgb_front_00826|we're just eyeballing this right now
EQWFrWeRVjQ-3-rgb_front_00827|we will have to definitely adjust
EQWFrWeRVjQ-3-rgb_front_00828|and i'm going to take this one and extend it a little bit more
EQWFrWeRVjQ-3-rgb_front_00829|and then this is the boom and then this is the head
EQWFrWeRVjQ-3-rgb_front_00830|we'll loosen--go ahead and loosen both of those and get the head to where you think it's close enough to an angle--a good angle and then the boom and tighten
EQWFrWeRVjQ-3-rgb_front_00831|you might wanna--it looks like it's a little [indiscernible]
EQWFrWeRVjQ-3-rgb_front_00832|i'm just eyeballing it

ETOZLBScxWY-3-rgb_front_00852|hi this is john stewart and this is some repair tips for your tent
ETOZLBScxWY-3-rgb_front_00853|the first thing you're going to run into when repairing a tent is you normally get small holes rips in your tent the mesh and other parts of the tent
ETOZLBScxWY-3-rgb_front_00854|the easiest way to repair these is duct tape
ETOZLBScxWY-3-rgb_front_00855|you can put a piece of duct tape on the inside of the rip and on the outside of the rip and just sandwich it together
ETOZLBScxWY-3-rgb_front_00856|this stuff will hold up during your camping trip but you do want to get it further repaired once you get back
ETOZLBScxWY-3-rgb_front_00857|other things you might run into is a broken pole
ETOZLBScxWY-3-rgb_front_00858|poles will tend to crack once they get bent into funky shapes that you might put them into
ETOZLBScxWY-3-rgb_front_00859|when you do encounter this if the crack is small once again put some duct tape over it and this will keep it from expanding and getting bigger
ETOZLBScxWY-3-rgb_front_00860|if you break a pole in half you can repair this be having an extra farel or a pole protector
ETOZLBScxWY-3-rgb_front_00861|another way to do this is to take two really hard sticks duct tape them on there together
ETOZLBScxWY-3-rgb_front_00862|this will get you through a camping trip but you'll probably want to replace your pole after that
ETOZLBScxWY-3-rgb_front_00863|if the pole's bungee breaks on the inside the pole will still go together it's just that you have to put it together piece by piece instead of just having it snap together
ETOZLBScxWY-3-rgb_front_00864|if your rain fly begins to leak or your tent begins to leak you need to take and replace the seam sealing on it
ETOZLBScxWY-3-rgb_front_00865|you just buy a tube of seam sealer run it across the seams and this will waterproof your seams to where you don't have any leaks or drains into your tent
ETOZLBScxWY-3-rgb_front_00866|if you have punctures in your ground fly you probably ought to replace the ground fly because this is the main protector from the bottom of your tent so you don't want to have any punctures or anything like that in your ground fly

Eh2AVkAQsxI-3-rgb_front_00884|hi i'm lauren i'm going to be discussing how to add natural highlights at home
Eh2AVkAQsxI-3-rgb_front_00885|if you do not feel as though you would like to go to a salon and just want to add your or change your color up a little bit to add a little bit more dimension you can go to any drugstore or any beauty destination and get a hair home lightening kit
Eh2AVkAQsxI-3-rgb_front_00886|ultimately you will mix up whatever the hair lightener is that they give you
Eh2AVkAQsxI-3-rgb_front_00887|and it will come with a little bit of a brush such as this or it may have a little bit more harder bristle then this one actually does
Eh2AVkAQsxI-3-rgb_front_00888|you will then simply mix up everything that they give you and follow the directions that they give you
Eh2AVkAQsxI-3-rgb_front_00889|and you would paint it on your hair
Eh2AVkAQsxI-3-rgb_front_00890|the best way to do that is to dip your brush in and then literally stroke it on to tiny sections that you would like to be lighter
Eh2AVkAQsxI-3-rgb_front_00891|lay them gently over the rest of the hair and then let them go you would do this with each section
Eh2AVkAQsxI-3-rgb_front_00892|you do not want to push them down because what will happen is that it will start to lighten those hairs underneath and it will cause you to have spots
Eh2AVkAQsxI-3-rgb_front_00893|very gently and lay them down
Eh2AVkAQsxI-3-rgb_front_00894|so that maybe they are not even directly touching that hair that's underneath
Eh2AVkAQsxI-3-rgb_front_00895|it will prevent any spotting and any errors that could occur
Eh2AVkAQsxI-3-rgb_front_00896|so you are going to put it down very gently just kind of release it
Eh2AVkAQsxI-3-rgb_front_00897|you can do that all throughout the head so that way you can lighten as many sections as you want
Eh2AVkAQsxI-3-rgb_front_00898|the one nice thing is that this is a little bit more paste so you can kind of say i like a highlight here and then you can actually put that highlight there
Eh2AVkAQsxI-3-rgb_front_00899|if you do have a lighter hair color more of like your very light brown or your dark blonde the home hair kit hair lightening systems may work out a little bit better for you
Eh2AVkAQsxI-3-rgb_front_00900|if your hair is very dark you may just want to go to your local salon because there width actions tends to not be as strong as what a professional can get and what will happen is it will leave your highlights looking very brassy very like very orangey and very very bright
Eh2AVkAQsxI-3-rgb_front_00901|i tend to find that people with a lighter base color have a bit of an easier time and better results in doing home hair lighting kits
Eh2AVkAQsxI-3-rgb_front_00902|and that is how to lighten your hair at home

EjzQn4ReeeI-3-rgb_front_00952|alright in this clip we'll be doing the upper body on our cute more cartoonized angel and we're just going to give him a simple white robe
EjzQn4ReeeI-3-rgb_front_00953|so we're going to start by drawing his neck in there like that maybe give him sort of a v-neck shape to his robe there
EjzQn4ReeeI-3-rgb_front_00954|draw the top edges of it
EjzQn4ReeeI-3-rgb_front_00955|now we're just going to come down and do his shoulders just like that
EjzQn4ReeeI-3-rgb_front_00956|swing down swoop down and give him some flowing robes here
EjzQn4ReeeI-3-rgb_front_00957|we're going to draw the sleeves coming into his side like that and as you draw his robe coming down to where his belt would be kind of give it a little bit of a outward curve so that when you come in and draw his belt like that it leaves a little bit of a realistic little space where the fabric would kind of bend in there like that like that
EjzQn4ReeeI-3-rgb_front_00958|you add a little swooping detail to the robe like that and then just draw his hands in there
EjzQn4ReeeI-3-rgb_front_00959|standard cartoon hands with the four fingers
EjzQn4ReeeI-3-rgb_front_00960|this guy definitely looks like he's wishing us peace on earth and good will to men
EjzQn4ReeeI-3-rgb_front_00961|and there
EjzQn4ReeeI-3-rgb_front_00962|you got the top of his robe his sleeves little belt there his hands and that will work well for his upper body
EjzQn4ReeeI-3-rgb_front_00963|and in the next clip we'll move on to the lower half of his body

EmNBzTLRz-E-3-rgb_front_00976|alice monsaert: this exercise is what i call an advanced level lunge because the back leg is going to stay straight
EmNBzTLRz-E-3-rgb_front_00977|in our regular lunge we should bend the back knee
EmNBzTLRz-E-3-rgb_front_00978|in this exercise the back leg is going to stay straight while the body moves forward over the forward quadriceps
EmNBzTLRz-E-3-rgb_front_00979|so we're going to do this onto bosu and incorporate again an upper body exercise along with it
EmNBzTLRz-E-3-rgb_front_00980|i like to do a lot of back work because typically our anterior is tight and our back is stretched so it's nice to have muscle balance and do a lot of back work
EmNBzTLRz-E-3-rgb_front_00981|so the advanced level lunge i stay up on the toe on the back get the heel off the floor keep the legs straight the knee silently soft lunge forward and then come straight
EmNBzTLRz-E-3-rgb_front_00982|so as i lunge my knees staying over the center of my foot
EmNBzTLRz-E-3-rgb_front_00983|if your knee goes past to your toe then just scoot your back leg forward--or back leg back a little bit and we're going to incorporate a row
EmNBzTLRz-E-3-rgb_front_00984|so i'm going to lunge row and come up
EmNBzTLRz-E-3-rgb_front_00985|lunge forward row for the back of the shoulders the lats or i can change that to incorporate a reverse fly
EmNBzTLRz-E-3-rgb_front_00986|so i'm going to go into that forward advanced level lunge with the back leg is straight do a reverse fly and come up
EmNBzTLRz-E-3-rgb_front_00987|so again my challenge comes from this forward foot being on the unstable surface
EmNBzTLRz-E-3-rgb_front_00988|forward and one more safety point for you we never want the spine rounded
EmNBzTLRz-E-3-rgb_front_00989|we want it lifted chest open and reverse fly

Enhria4v_jo-3-rgb_front_01004|hi i'm judy carrier with jewels by park lane and i'm going to tell you how to clean your sterling silver jewelry
Enhria4v_jo-3-rgb_front_01005|first of all you put a pot of water on to boil just like you would if you're having a baby in the old movies
Enhria4v_jo-3-rgb_front_01006|get a glass pot or an aluminum pan either one will work
Enhria4v_jo-3-rgb_front_01007|if you have a glass pot or something just fill it line it with aluminum foil just plain old aluminum foil that you use on the turkey
Enhria4v_jo-3-rgb_front_01008|and then take some baking soda and sprinkle it liberally over the foil
Enhria4v_jo-3-rgb_front_01009|put your jewelry in there
Enhria4v_jo-3-rgb_front_01010|set it in and then you pour the hot water over it
Enhria4v_jo-3-rgb_front_01011|now it's going to fizz up smell kind of like rotten eggs it's not the nicest smelling
Enhria4v_jo-3-rgb_front_01012|you let it sit there a while until it's completely dissolved and you might want to shake the pan a little or just stir it to make sure that the baking powder is completely dissolved
Enhria4v_jo-3-rgb_front_01013|and while that is cleaning you might want to air out the windows or something but open a window to get that smell out
Enhria4v_jo-3-rgb_front_01014|but pour the water off when it's quit fizzing and take it out rinse it and pat it dry with a lint free cloth and your jewelry should look as good as new

FMSiqrDXABU-3-rgb_front_01028|okay right now we're going to talk about laying out the job
FMSiqrDXABU-3-rgb_front_01029|what you're going to want to do is go and measure where the fence is going to be and make yourself a hand drawn diagram
FMSiqrDXABU-3-rgb_front_01030|here we've measured out our yard and determined that we're going to have a certain footage on this side along the back the other side and drawn it out how we want it to lay out with the fence and the gates
FMSiqrDXABU-3-rgb_front_01031|from this hand drawn diagram you can then come up with a custom layout depending on what spacing you want to set your post
FMSiqrDXABU-3-rgb_front_01032|we've got a custom layout here that goes right along with that hand drawn diagram
FMSiqrDXABU-3-rgb_front_01033|where we've taken a 77 inch center to center spacing which is a 72 inch opening between post and figured out what each side- how many sections would be on each side determining which post would be required and how many of each kind of post
FMSiqrDXABU-3-rgb_front_01034|with this diagram you can then prepare to lay out the job on the ground
_2FBDaOPYig-3-rgb_front_01035|today i am going to be showing you how to make gourmet french fries cooked in duck fat
_2FBDaOPYig-3-rgb_front_01036|so we are currently heating up the oil and at this point you are going to want to be very very careful unless you rendered the duck fat yourself
_2FBDaOPYig-3-rgb_front_01037|i bought this at the store and there appears to be a great deal of moisture in the actual fat
_2FBDaOPYig-3-rgb_front_01038|so what is happening you see all the bubbles on top right there
_2FBDaOPYig-3-rgb_front_01039|that is the water coming out of the oil which means it was probably improperly stored at the store or it was allowed to partially thaw and then refrigerate
_2FBDaOPYig-3-rgb_front_01040|i am going to let this go until i don't see any bubbles in there
_2FBDaOPYig-3-rgb_front_01041|i do have it a little hotter than usual
_2FBDaOPYig-3-rgb_front_01042|it's about 350 right now and i want to get it to 325
_2FBDaOPYig-3-rgb_front_01043|so i am just going to turn the heat down a little bit and let it back off some and wait for these bubbles to come out
_2FBDaOPYig-3-rgb_front_01044|but like i said be really really careful
_2FBDaOPYig-3-rgb_front_01045|it has already popped on me twice; really really big
_2FBDaOPYig-3-rgb_front_01046|like 2 foot high oil explosions so just be really really careful and make sure you don't burn your house down and don't burn yourself

_5CV2fIG7qY-3-rgb_front_01062|this is a little device i found it makes it easier to keep in the blind to make it stand up but you've got to make sure you've got a good stabilizer on it

a4Nxq0QV_WA-5-rgb_front_01139|i'm going to let go of my right hand i'm going to grab his heel
a4Nxq0QV_WA-5-rgb_front_01140|i'm going to lift this leg and throw it that way as i throw my feet towards the floor here maintaining control again keep my knees together and then bridge

a5yNwUSiYpA-3-rgb_front_01163|ok what i'm going to be performing here is called a front squat now the traditional squat usually you see the bar behind the neck
a5yNwUSiYpA-3-rgb_front_01164|this is in front of your body
a5yNwUSiYpA-3-rgb_front_01165|it's going to be laying on your shoulders
a5yNwUSiYpA-3-rgb_front_01166|cross over your arms to keep the bar steady and to hold there
a5yNwUSiYpA-3-rgb_front_01167|now the front squat develops your teardrop
a5yNwUSiYpA-3-rgb_front_01168|that's what we call it at the gym
a5yNwUSiYpA-3-rgb_front_01169|which is the front part of your quads that's near the knee cap
a5yNwUSiYpA-3-rgb_front_01170|you want to go down with the bar come up
a5yNwUSiYpA-3-rgb_front_01171|again just like the squat you want to push from the heels
a5yNwUSiYpA-3-rgb_front_01172|keep your body steady throughout the whole flow
a5yNwUSiYpA-3-rgb_front_01173|do about depending on the amount of weight you're doing if you're going real heavy do about eight to ten reps
a5yNwUSiYpA-3-rgb_front_01174|if going real light you want to to about ten to fifteen
a5yNwUSiYpA-3-rgb_front_01175|again the front squat you're going to concentrate a lot on the front part next to the knee cap to help develop those better
a5yNwUSiYpA-3-rgb_front_01176|and that's how you perform the front squat
a5yNwUSiYpA-5-rgb_front_01177|ok what i'm going to be performing here is called a front squat now the traditional squat usually you see the bar behind the neck
a5yNwUSiYpA-5-rgb_front_01178|this is in front of your body
a5yNwUSiYpA-5-rgb_front_01179|it's going to be laying on your shoulders
a5yNwUSiYpA-5-rgb_front_01180|cross over your arms to keep the bar steady and to hold there
a5yNwUSiYpA-5-rgb_front_01181|now the front squat develops your teardrop

a5yNwUSiYpA-5-rgb_front_01186|keep your body steady throughout the whole flow
a5yNwUSiYpA-5-rgb_front_01187|do about depending on the amount of weight you're doing if you're going real heavy do about eight to ten reps
a5yNwUSiYpA-5-rgb_front_01188|if going real light you want to to about ten to fifteen
a5yNwUSiYpA-5-rgb_front_01189|again the front squat you're going to concentrate a lot on the front part next to the knee cap to help develop those better
a5yNwUSiYpA-5-rgb_front_01190|and that's how you perform the front squat
aUBqWgdXamE-3-rgb_front_01191|i think we pretty much fixed our leaky little problem in here
aUBqWgdXamE-3-rgb_front_01192|so what we did was we took this old housing off and replaced our old leaky cartridge which is this one with a brand new one
aUBqWgdXamE-3-rgb_front_01193|i think we've probably solved our problems
aUBqWgdXamE-3-rgb_front_01194|at this point is not going to be anymore leaks in this shower
aUBqWgdXamE-3-rgb_front_01195|again this is something that you can do at home
aUBqWgdXamE-3-rgb_front_01196|it is really not hard if you know the tricks and that is it for me today
abzRFn8xngA-3-rgb_front_01197|normally what i would do if i was doing a spell for healing is i would write out a petition
abzRFn8xngA-3-rgb_front_01198|and that would be almost like a prayer saying what i intend to do and for whom i intend to do it
abzRFn8xngA-3-rgb_front_01199|then i sometimes use a poppet as i had mentioned before and i wrap herbs around it
abzRFn8xngA-3-rgb_front_01200|or if say they had a broken leg i would concentrate the healing on the leg part
abzRFn8xngA-3-rgb_front_01201|sometimes what i do is i'll take a photograph and put the photograph over the face so that it actually looks like the person
abzRFn8xngA-3-rgb_front_01202|that's called sympathetic magic
abzRFn8xngA-3-rgb_front_01203|where i'm not actually doing the magic on somebody but i'm doing it on something instead
abzRFn8xngA-3-rgb_front_01204|and then i would place it on the pentacle and i would continue with the spell saying what i would want for the healing and want for the person
abzRFn8xngA-3-rgb_front_01205|and of course for the highest good of all and that it harm none
afDfb8xx09w-3-rgb_front_01206|now we're going to be talking about direction of the ball
afDfb8xx09w-3-rgb_front_01207|basically you have two directions that we're going to be talking about
afDfb8xx09w-3-rgb_front_01208|for forehand on the line the same concept; you're going to be hitting the ball
afDfb8xx09w-3-rgb_front_01209|you're going to hit it just a little more behind
ahJr2i50Qew-3-rgb_front_01210|one thing as you notice we don't have any three point lines here but that wasn't always part of the game and this court was probably created during sometime during that period is the three point line
ahJr2i50Qew-3-rgb_front_01211|the three point line is actually i talked about it earlier is nineteen point nine for college and high school and actually nba the nba line is a little further out it's at twenty three nine twenty three feet nine inches
ahJr2i50Qew-3-rgb_front_01212|so whenever you're shooting same shooting mechanics apply
ahJr2i50Qew-3-rgb_front_01213|you want to take your take your three point shot
ahJr2i50Qew-3-rgb_front_01214|i'm going to show you i'm going to take actually go across court here and show you exactly what a round about what a three point shot would be being is how we don't have actually have a three point line on our court
ahJr2i50Qew-3-rgb_front_01215|so check me out
ahJr2i50Qew-3-rgb_front_01216|when you're coming over here and you're shooting a three point shot same shooting mechanics apply as a regular shot no changes you just might down here you probably want to shoot a jump shot unless you're strong enough to actually get it there with a set shot
ahJr2i50Qew-3-rgb_front_01217|so when you're taking a taking your three point shot you want to make sure if you're playing outside outdoors you got to allot for the wind that's the thing about playing outside
ahJr2i50Qew-3-rgb_front_01218|you've always got to allot for the wind
ahJr2i50Qew-3-rgb_front_01219|so if you're taking this a little more distance so when you're shooting the three point shot you allot for the wind and there you go just like that you take the shot
ahJr2i50Qew-3-rgb_front_01220|so same shooting mechanics apply and there you have it shooting the three point shot
aoJDJktJkzw-3-rgb_front_01221|okay so our kimchi is pretty all mixed up now and when you are doing this at home you can really set this aside and let the pickling process happen for a good solid 1/2 hour to a hour and you can see now already the different of the texture of the kimchi
aoJDJktJkzw-3-rgb_front_01222|the cucumber is not stiff anymore i mean it would still break and when you eat it it has a nice crunch to it
aoJDJktJkzw-3-rgb_front_01223|so once it is ready all we have to do is revisit our rice which is now done is the rice cooker
aoJDJktJkzw-3-rgb_front_01224|spoon some of it wooden paddles work really well and then serve up some of our kimchi
aoJDJktJkzw-3-rgb_front_01225|you can do it over the rice the side of the rice you can do it however you like and if you are really ambushes and you went to the asian market and got some kimchi traditional kimchi
aoJDJktJkzw-3-rgb_front_01226|i'm going to put that in to and there you have your basic korean meal vegetarian
at8bAQq9jZY-3-rgb_front_01227|one of the ways that i like to continue to create my sound is i use what is called a loop station
at8bAQq9jZY-3-rgb_front_01228|a loop station is basically a live recording its a xor input or a quarter inch input depending on what type of model you have that goes into the loop station and what you do is your press basically a peddle and it starts to record
at8bAQq9jZY-3-rgb_front_01229|when you press the peddle again it starts to play what you just recorded live back to you and back to the audience and doing so you can create a mean sound with a lot of stuff layered on top of it
at8bAQq9jZY-3-rgb_front_01230|it's very creative way to show people what your about to help facilitate really what your music is about and creating a sound on stage
at8bAQq9jZY-3-rgb_front_01231|people really love it other musicians really dig it that's one way to broaden your musical horizons
b-mHbL3d2ec-3-rgb_front_01232|just trim off the little root section and peel off that outer brown skin now to chop an onion you want to leave that little root section on there
b-mHbL3d2ec-3-rgb_front_01233|and when you cut down to your onion you only cut in here you start there you don't want to cut the onion from here because then the whole onion falls apart if you start in this area and then slice down it will hold the onion together see how the onion stays together
b-mHbL3d2ec-3-rgb_front_01234|and then you can just slice straight across and you get a nice medium cut onion and then you can just at that point cut up the rest the roots section
b-mHbL3d2ec-3-rgb_front_01235|set that aside and then continue with our other onions just take off a little of that and peel it off and by keeping the onion together like this it helps to cut down on the amount of onion vapors you get to because your not chop chopping everywhere with the onions going everywhere it stays compacted and it's very quick to cut an onion like this
b-mHbL3d2ec-3-rgb_front_01236|just continue that with all your onions now i'm going to show you how to peel and chop the garlic the easy way to get the skin off of the garlic is to take a flat a big knife a flat knife and just push with the palm of your hand to crush the garlic and the skin will fall right off
b-mHbL3d2ec-3-rgb_front_01237|another way to crush the garlic is to take a steardy glass or jar and just give that a little whack that also crush the garlic and the peel just comes right off i'm just going to rough chop this garlic and add it to our onions next we'll prep the leak
b9zJhvHGxyk-3-rgb_front_01238|my name is kristy i'm working at the curves in west jordan utah
b9zJhvHGxyk-3-rgb_front_01239|we are talking about weight loss tips
b9zJhvHGxyk-3-rgb_front_01240|a really good way to lose weight sometimes is a support group
b9zJhvHGxyk-3-rgb_front_01241|having friends to do it with you family members or even joining the support group
b9zJhvHGxyk-3-rgb_front_01242|at curves we do offer nutrition classes that is a group of ladies that are all the same goal we meet once a week and we talk about suggestions for each other
b9zJhvHGxyk-3-rgb_front_01243|tips on different salad dressings we've used that are lower fat that taste better
b9zJhvHGxyk-3-rgb_front_01244|just to have a group of women doing it with you or even friends or a spouse someone that's there to support you that knows what you are going through
b9zJhvHGxyk-3-rgb_front_01245|and can help you through it and you can help them
b9zJhvHGxyk-3-rgb_front_01246|so you know if you want to find one you can bring a friend if not if you do go to a facility like curves or other facilities they do offer support groups where you can do it with a group of friends and you can all lose weight together
b9zJhvHGxyk-3-rgb_front_01247|another part of our support group is we with these ladies on the wall they make a paper doll that resembles themselves and if they come to curves at least three times a week through the busy summer where a lot of people make it find it hard to work out they stay in our camp and we keep track of them call them let them know that we are they haven't hit there three times a week that week
b9zJhvHGxyk-3-rgb_front_01248|and there's different ways to we support our ladies through exercising three times a week
bBHYQCDp_9A-3-rgb_front_01249|when you're running a press the defense is running a press one thing that you want to learn how to do is break that press
bBHYQCDp_9A-3-rgb_front_01250|hi i'm travis and i'm about to teach you exactly how you can do that when you're on the basketball court
bBHYQCDp_9A-3-rgb_front_01251|number one when there is a press a defensive press what you want to make sure you do is when you have the guy in the person inbound the ball you want to make sure that they have options
bBHYQCDp_9A-3-rgb_front_01252|somewhere back here so that when they get in trouble cause you don't want them out of bounds for five seconds when they get in trouble they can find someone to pass it to
bBHYQCDp_9A-3-rgb_front_01253|usually it'll be you'll have two guards you'll have your point guard and your shooting guard back here
bBHYQCDp_9A-3-rgb_front_01254|and what they'll do for each other is they'll set screens and when he or she smacks the ball you'll have them split to try to get open once the ball is inbound and they get the ball then that point guard or that shooting guard will take control of the game and look for their options
bBHYQCDp_9A-3-rgb_front_01255|now the two guards are back here you'll have you may have the center all the way back or you may have the center somewhere closer to the top of the key on the opposite top of the key
bBHYQCDp_9A-3-rgb_front_01256|but you also want to have your forwards around half court so that they have so that your guards have options if they get in trouble
bBHYQCDp_9A-3-rgb_front_01257|now you want to make sure that you pass the half court line within within the time frame the ten second time frame but you want to also make sure that everybody is constantly moving cause you're breaking that press there's pressure there's going to be pressure that gets you that's what the press is
bBHYQCDp_9A-3-rgb_front_01258|so you want to have your offensive players down the court constantly moving and constantly setting screens for each other so they can get open
bBHYQCDp_9A-3-rgb_front_01259|once that is the key to breaking the press
bBHYQCDp_9A-3-rgb_front_01260|the press once a guard has the ball in the middle of the court the press is pretty much broken then the then the thing is finding someone to pass it to and getting it down court
bBHYQCDp_9A-3-rgb_front_01261|so try your best to get that person whoever is going to have the ball after it's inbound to get into the middle of the court so that they have options on the right and on their left
bBHYQCDp_9A-3-rgb_front_01262|once that happens there you have it breaking the press
bHdXYjk977I-3-rgb_front_01263|next we are going to talk about is i am going to do a necklace and i am going to make a turquoise necklace since i have lots of turquoise here to choose from
bHdXYjk977I-3-rgb_front_01264|i am going to use a toggle clasp which has a circle and it also has an end piece here with a chain
bHdXYjk977I-3-rgb_front_01265|so i am going to put this at the mark at eight so we can do a sixteen inch length necklace
bHdXYjk977I-3-rgb_front_01266|this is the type of bead i am going to use
bHdXYjk977I-3-rgb_front_01267|its called a flat disk
bHdXYjk977I-3-rgb_front_01268|there is also this type but i am going to use this one today and drape it on here so we know exactly if its going to be sixteen inches
bHdXYjk977I-3-rgb_front_01269|and most manufacturers when you buy your beads they come in sixteen inch length
bHdXYjk977I-3-rgb_front_01270|now because this is such a simple design here i thought maybe a little centerpiece would be nice
bHdXYjk977I-3-rgb_front_01271|so i was going through my large beads here and i was looking to see which one would match up nicely
bHdXYjk977I-3-rgb_front_01272|this one looks a little too blue here
bHdXYjk977I-3-rgb_front_01273|lets see what would look nice with the necklace and i think this one would look nice as a centerpiece
bHdXYjk977I-3-rgb_front_01274|that would look really good
bHdXYjk977I-3-rgb_front_01275|and what we will do is we will make a little bead go onto the end of this piece here to make it look like a little nice centerpiece
bHdXYjk977I-3-rgb_front_01276|there is the beads
bHdXYjk977I-3-rgb_front_01277|we will put it on the end here so that it will be a nice centerpiece for your necklace and this will be our design
bHdXYjk977I-3-rgb_front_01278|that will be the beginning of it
bIUmw2DVW7Q-3-rgb_front_01279|a wrist control that we can use from a slashing attack
bIUmw2DVW7Q-3-rgb_front_01280|we're going to do it from the outside
bIUmw2DVW7Q-3-rgb_front_01281|we want to create a protective barrier once again
bIUmw2DVW7Q-3-rgb_front_01282|create a diversionary framework a danny comes in here i want to follow that motion trap on top of the wrist right here and as he begins to pull back to get into position i want to follow him once again
bIUmw2DVW7Q-3-rgb_front_01283|a technique we have seen several times before
bIUmw2DVW7Q-3-rgb_front_01284|because it's exceptionally effective
bIUmw2DVW7Q-3-rgb_front_01285|which is why we're seeing it again
bIUmw2DVW7Q-3-rgb_front_01286|here i create my protective line
bIUmw2DVW7Q-3-rgb_front_01287|i'm off the line of attack
bIUmw2DVW7Q-3-rgb_front_01288|the blade's far enough away from me that if it misses it misses
bIUmw2DVW7Q-3-rgb_front_01289|i'm here
bIUmw2DVW7Q-3-rgb_front_01290|i'm here
bIUmw2DVW7Q-3-rgb_front_01291|and then i control the hand
bIUmw2DVW7Q-3-rgb_front_01292|he wants to bring it back naturally
bIUmw2DVW7Q-3-rgb_front_01293|i'll flow with him
bIUmw2DVW7Q-3-rgb_front_01294|we don't want to get into a wrestling match
bIUmw2DVW7Q-3-rgb_front_01295|i don't want to fight him down here to keep it here
bIUmw2DVW7Q-3-rgb_front_01296|he want to bring it up
bIUmw2DVW7Q-3-rgb_front_01297|that's fine
bIUmw2DVW7Q-3-rgb_front_01298|i'll go right with him
bIUmw2DVW7Q-3-rgb_front_01299|boom
bIUmw2DVW7Q-3-rgb_front_01300|we want to control the motion and use his energy against him as much as possible
bIUmw2DVW7Q-3-rgb_front_01301|this motion is nice and small in an ever shrinking circle going gently past his forearm down into the ground
bIUmw2DVW7Q-3-rgb_front_01302|i don't want to heave him 40 yards away
bIUmw2DVW7Q-3-rgb_front_01303|i want him on the ground at my feet as quickly as possible
bIUmw2DVW7Q-3-rgb_front_01304|here and down we go to the ground
bIUmw2DVW7Q-3-rgb_front_01305|and that is a good wrist control from a slashing attack
bUFsn9GQsCg-8-rgb_front_01306|i have some very good news for you about the feral cat
bUFsn9GQsCg-8-rgb_front_01307|the los angeles police department is now employing feral cats who otherwise would have been euphemized at shelters to fight rats and mice at two police stations; one at the southeastern branch and the other the central branch
bUFsn9GQsCg-8-rgb_front_01308|and they report excellent success because once the mice and rats smell the presence of the cats they flee
bUFsn9GQsCg-8-rgb_front_01309|the cats don't even have to chase them
bUFsn9GQsCg-8-rgb_front_01310|and it's said that at parker center downtown la their main center are now going to enjoy having the feral cats drive out the rats there
bUFsn9GQsCg-8-rgb_front_01311|and you know i think this should be carried out around the country
bUFsn9GQsCg-8-rgb_front_01312|wherever there's a rat problem; whether it be police departments or elsewhere because the feral cats do an excellent job and they would otherwise i'm sorry to say be euphemized
bUFsn9GQsCg-8-rgb_front_01313|now from south korea we have another case of cats that's very interesting
bUFsn9GQsCg-8-rgb_front_01314|they've just cloned glow-in-the-dark kitties
bUFsn9GQsCg-8-rgb_front_01315|yes they're giving them genes that make them glow in the dark when they're subjected to ultraviolet light
bUFsn9GQsCg-8-rgb_front_01316|very cute and of course people want to buy them they're turkish angoras
bUFsn9GQsCg-8-rgb_front_01317|the idea is that this research may actually lead to the cure of a human disease
bUFsn9GQsCg-8-rgb_front_01318|right now it's just a very cute idea
bUFsn9GQsCg-8-rgb_front_01319|and you know what i say to that
bUFsn9GQsCg-8-rgb_front_01320|meow meow meow
bX0Zpf-rEgc-8-rgb_front_01321|tonight we're going to work and walk you through some advance bowling techniques so you can improve your game
bX0Zpf-rEgc-8-rgb_front_01322|from the stand point tonight we've covered a lot of information
bX0Zpf-rEgc-8-rgb_front_01323|we've talked basically about the stance we've talked about how to move the ball through the stance release position spare shooting how to change speed on the ball
bX0Zpf-rEgc-8-rgb_front_01324|we've given you a lot of information from a stand point now it's time to take the information go out on the lanes and play with it
bb1Z5dw4N-s-8-rgb_front_01325|now there are a few disadvantages to impromptu speaking
bb1Z5dw4N-s-8-rgb_front_01326|the first one that you need to be aware of is that your audience could get bored alright
bb1Z5dw4N-s-8-rgb_front_01327|and a lot of this has to do with structure which i'm going to talk about in a minute but you're thinking on your feet
bb1Z5dw4N-s-8-rgb_front_01328|you know the topic but you have to while you're speaking impromptu with no preparation you have to keep your audience interested
bb1Z5dw4N-s-8-rgb_front_01329|you can't ramble on you can't have random organizational patterns you have to keep the audience with you
bb1Z5dw4N-s-8-rgb_front_01330|so that's something that you run the risk of is your audience not staying with you
bb1Z5dw4N-s-8-rgb_front_01331|obviously your goal your aim is to appear effective as a public speaker giving a well thought-out speech
bb1Z5dw4N-s-8-rgb_front_01332|well you're at a disadvantage if you're giving an impromptu speech because you're not giving a well thought-out speech you just met the topic
bb1Z5dw4N-s-8-rgb_front_01333|so you have to try and present a well thought-out speech but you have to be careful because you have had no preparation time
bb1Z5dw4N-s-8-rgb_front_01334|you also one of the negatives is that you can't really put a lot of attention on details -you haven't had time to research you haven't had time to come up with the finesse and the finite things about your speech so you're going to miss out on some of those details
bb1Z5dw4N-s-8-rgb_front_01335|and those are some of the negatives that are not such great things about impromptu speaking so just be aware of that when you're having to give an impromptu speech
bb1Z5dw4N-s-8-rgb_front_01336|know that those are some of the pitfalls so that you might avoid them
bbSKqkE4EBs-8-rgb_front_01337|in this segment we're going to take a moment to talk about the benefits of qigong breathing
bbSKqkE4EBs-8-rgb_front_01338|the essence of all qigong exercises is in the exercise of the breath and although there's wonderful energetic reasons on why we do the particular qigong exercises we do i like to talk more about the western physiological reasons of why the belly breathing that we often times do is so beneficial
bbSKqkE4EBs-8-rgb_front_01339|one of the main reasons is the lymphatic system of our body
bbSKqkE4EBs-8-rgb_front_01340|the lymphatic system has two pumps
bbSKqkE4EBs-8-rgb_front_01341|one we get through exercise muscle contraction and the other one is through the action of the diaphragm the muscle that we're supposed to use in respiration
bbSKqkE4EBs-8-rgb_front_01342|the dome shaped muscle that's here right underneath our lungs and then when we breathe in it comes down and when we breathe out it comes up
bbSKqkE4EBs-8-rgb_front_01343|that action of the diaphragm actually moves two thirds of the lymphatic fluids of our body lymph being i hate to say it the gook of our body or the waste products of many of our body's systems
bbSKqkE4EBs-8-rgb_front_01344|so one of the best way we can do a cleanse or to feel better and more energized is just through breathing
bbSKqkE4EBs-8-rgb_front_01345|it has other benefits where in that it actually works towards helping regulate the ph of our blood which can be beneficial for preventing osteoporosis and so although the calcium in our bones is the primary way the breathing is the second most common way for our body to treat that
bbSKqkE4EBs-8-rgb_front_01346|so we can actually have benefits of preventing osteoporosis just by breathing properly
bbSKqkE4EBs-8-rgb_front_01347|will also be helping with all that shack neck and shoulder pain that we often get from stress breathing that we'll talk about in the next segment
bbSKqkE4EBs-8-rgb_front_01348|so remember belly breathe is the way we're supposed to breathe
bcNtUYh3GNs-8-rgb_front_01349|i'm veronyka bass from veronyka's color salon and day spa
bcNtUYh3GNs-8-rgb_front_01350|now we're going to have her lean back get comfortable
bcNtUYh3GNs-8-rgb_front_01351|and this is where we're going to use the warm water
bcNtUYh3GNs-8-rgb_front_01352|more on the warm side than not hot or cold
bcNtUYh3GNs-8-rgb_front_01353|so we're going to get ready to shampoo her and at the very end of a shampoo it's nice to give it a cold rinse so it seals the cuticle
bcNtUYh3GNs-8-rgb_front_01354|alot of people don't realize that
bcNtUYh3GNs-8-rgb_front_01355|it's going to be a little bit of a cold shower but it seals the cuticle
bcNtUYh3GNs-8-rgb_front_01356|now i'm getting ready to use our shampoo to bring the ph balance down
bcNtUYh3GNs-8-rgb_front_01357|this will stop the total continuation of processing
bjvIIdYWc-k-8-rgb_front_01358|right now we are going to discuss choosing the right paint for your project
bjvIIdYWc-k-8-rgb_front_01359|what i have here in my hand is a paint wheel
bjvIIdYWc-k-8-rgb_front_01360|it gives the different colors that independent stores would offer
bjvIIdYWc-k-8-rgb_front_01361|so you can have specific selections to choose from
bjvIIdYWc-k-8-rgb_front_01362|depending upon the application you are going to either want to get a flat a eggshell a satin gloss semi-gloss all that can be done regardless of your color chooses
bjvIIdYWc-k-8-rgb_front_01363|personally i would put a gloss or a semi-gloss on your doors and eggshells or a satin on your walls
bjvIIdYWc-k-8-rgb_front_01364|you can use flat to go along your ceilings or you can use a satin finish for that as well
bjvIIdYWc-k-8-rgb_front_01365|the reason for this for the different changes is to bring out the different colors the different textures and also the ability and clean ability
bjvIIdYWc-k-8-rgb_front_01366|a higher gloss paint is going to give you a more cleanable surface or as a flat paint is not easily as clean
bpOKSl0oIIw-8-rgb_front_01367|today we're going to be learning how to play portal a game by valve software
bpOKSl0oIIw-8-rgb_front_01368|a company with which i have no affiliation
bpOKSl0oIIw-8-rgb_front_01369|all right
bpOKSl0oIIw-8-rgb_front_01370|here we are in test chamber 08
bpOKSl0oIIw-8-rgb_front_01371|we've got some new icons here now
bpOKSl0oIIw-8-rgb_front_01372|we've got the old familiar power ball death power ball power conduit and now it looks like we've got some other ones
bpOKSl0oIIw-8-rgb_front_01373|the risk of drowning and don't drink the water
bpOKSl0oIIw-8-rgb_front_01374|so we look here in test chamber 08
bpOKSl0oIIw-8-rgb_front_01375|we can see that the floor is actually sort of toxic goo
bpOKSl0oIIw-8-rgb_front_01376|the sort of toxic goo that you wouldn't want to find yourself in
bpOKSl0oIIw-8-rgb_front_01377|so we want to avoid hitting the floor of test chamber 08 at all costs
bpOKSl0oIIw-8-rgb_front_01378|we look over here on our left we've got a power ball dispenser and an orange portal and a power conduit
bpOKSl0oIIw-8-rgb_front_01379|what we need to do is find a way to get the power ball over to the conduit and that will activate this elevator and let us get to the exit
bpOKSl0oIIw-8-rgb_front_01380|but we need to be careful because if we come out of this orange portal and get hit by the power ball we will die
bpOKSl0oIIw-8-rgb_front_01381|so we need to find a different way of doing things
cDJuwtDYaSg-8-rgb_front_01382|alright the drink that we are about to make is a black and tan
cDJuwtDYaSg-8-rgb_front_01383|now there's a lot of debate on what two beers are supposed to be used for a black and tan
cDJuwtDYaSg-8-rgb_front_01384|but if you ask most people they'll tell you that guinness and bask ale
cDJuwtDYaSg-8-rgb_front_01385|first thing we're going to do is we're going to take a pint glass and start by pouring in your bask half way
cDJuwtDYaSg-8-rgb_front_01386|and we're going to fill it the rest of the way with guinness
cDJuwtDYaSg-8-rgb_front_01387|and the guinness is darker
cDJuwtDYaSg-8-rgb_front_01388|you will see the difference in the top and the bottom
cDJuwtDYaSg-8-rgb_front_01389|it should have a nice distinction between that and let's get a close up so you can see
cDJuwtDYaSg-8-rgb_front_01390|and the top should be a little bit darker than the bottom
cDJuwtDYaSg-8-rgb_front_01391|and that's a black and tan
cDJuwtDYaSg-8-rgb_front_01392|so anytime you want to spice up your guinness a little bit and you don't feel like having just a bask make yourself a black and tan a mixture of both
cDJuwtDYaSg-8-rgb_front_01393|bottoms up
cHFW_U9e4sM-8-rgb_front_01394|the next point you're going to use for the lower legs especially is inner courtyard or stomach 44
cHFW_U9e4sM-8-rgb_front_01395|and this one is really easy to find it's literally between the second and third toe
cHFW_U9e4sM-8-rgb_front_01396|so you're just going to rub in between the toes
cHFW_U9e4sM-8-rgb_front_01397|just run your finger in there massage in between the toes and this is another good one for dispersing pain relaxing the muscles and dogs like to generally have their feet massaged by their owners they don't like them touched by the vets much but quite often they'll let the owners do just about anything
cHFW_U9e4sM-8-rgb_front_01398|you can do a full foot massage on them if you like
cHFW_U9e4sM-8-rgb_front_01399|there's good acupressure points in between the other toes as well but this one specifically for muscle stiffness and pain in the back limbs
cHFW_U9e4sM-8-rgb_front_01400|so you'll want to work that one and again do both sides because quite often if this knee is hurting he's compensating by using this leg
cHFW_U9e4sM-8-rgb_front_01401|so you're causing discomfort and stiffness in both legs
cHFW_U9e4sM-8-rgb_front_01402|you want to work that point
cHFW_U9e4sM-8-rgb_front_01403|again this is a massage just rubbing that muscle between your fingers the tissues between your fingers and really rub that fairly hard feel that skin move around so that you know that you're getting some real movement in the area
cOCnNdL5fwI-8-rgb_front_01404|i'm here to discuss short curly locks with you
cOCnNdL5fwI-8-rgb_front_01405|the tools that you're going to want to use to create a curl can consist of thermal styling tools which is ultimately your curling iron
cOCnNdL5fwI-8-rgb_front_01406|curling irons come in various diameters they come very small 1/2 they go to 3/4 the 1 1 1/2 and then the 2
cOCnNdL5fwI-8-rgb_front_01407|the longer the larger the diameter the looser the weight is going to be
cOCnNdL5fwI-8-rgb_front_01408|now when somebody like heather's hair you also must take into consideration the length of her hair
cOCnNdL5fwI-8-rgb_front_01409|if i was to use this on this section it would only do one turn it would be very very loose and it would literally use something like this on shorter hair just to kind to give it a little bevel around the face
cOCnNdL5fwI-8-rgb_front_01410|just to really kind to get the hair to either go under or flip out the smaller diameter will work best on her hair
cOCnNdL5fwI-8-rgb_front_01411|another great benefit with curling irons such as this one is does have a heat adjustment on it
cOCnNdL5fwI-8-rgb_front_01412|the heat adjustment will allow for you to adjust the heat to order to cater to your hair
cOCnNdL5fwI-8-rgb_front_01413|now heather has very fine hair and this goes to extra hot
cOCnNdL5fwI-8-rgb_front_01414|she's not going to need something extra hot in order to go on her hair so you can actually bring it down to maybe your highs speed or high temperature
cOCnNdL5fwI-8-rgb_front_01415|the courser your hair is the hotter the most you would likely need your thermal styling tool to be in order to really work on your hair
cOCnNdL5fwI-8-rgb_front_01416|now if i grab this the softer the curl is the better it would be especially you can see when they're going to fall
cOCnNdL5fwI-8-rgb_front_01417|so you can see that the curl is very tight very wiggly
cOCnNdL5fwI-8-rgb_front_01418|that is what you want when you're working with shorter hair especially fine and straight hair
cOCnNdL5fwI-8-rgb_front_01419|it's going to help achieve your style and it's going to help you maintain your movement maintaining your curl and also add some volume
cS44xaCZy7A-8-rgb_front_01420|we're now going to start lunging the horse
cS44xaCZy7A-8-rgb_front_01421|you'll notice that i still have the chain over my horseâs nose
cS44xaCZy7A-8-rgb_front_01422|this just gives me a little bit more control
cS44xaCZy7A-8-rgb_front_01423|i also have put on a pair of gloves and this is a really important thing to do to protect your hands from getting burned if your horse decides he doesn't want to behave and stay on the circle
cS44xaCZy7A-8-rgb_front_01424|it also lets you grip the lunge line a little bit better
cS44xaCZy7A-8-rgb_front_01425|i also have a lunge whip and this is an important tool in order for us to communicate that we want our horse to go forward and we're also in an enclosed arena
cS44xaCZy7A-8-rgb_front_01426|so that if something does go wrong he can't get out
cS44xaCZy7A-8-rgb_front_01427|so i'm going to start by just letting him come into a small circle around me
cYtd23-StEw-8-rgb_front_01428|hi

c_ThRj8eAf0-8-rgb_front_01449|so we are in the roll your own portion of shotgun
c_ThRj8eAf0-8-rgb_front_01450|we've each rolled one card we've had a betting round
c_ThRj8eAf0-8-rgb_front_01451|what happens now
c_ThRj8eAf0-8-rgb_front_01452|well we're going to roll another card right
c_ThRj8eAf0-8-rgb_front_01453|player to my left rolls a jack of hearts to match his queen of hearts
c_ThRj8eAf0-8-rgb_front_01454|we see what he's trying to sell there right
c_ThRj8eAf0-8-rgb_front_01455|he's trying to sell a straight or a flush or a straight flush or a royal flush
c_ThRj8eAf0-8-rgb_front_01456|you roll a ten to match your jack which is also the same suit
c_ThRj8eAf0-8-rgb_front_01457|you too are trying to sell a straight a flush a straight flush or a royal
c_ThRj8eAf0-8-rgb_front_01458|to your left we see again a sales pitch and i roll out a potential straight
c_ThRj8eAf0-8-rgb_front_01459|so we're all selling here and considering that these hands are on similar footing i don't think any of us are going away but you should bet and we'll talk more about that in the next segment
cw5evdziBB4-8-rgb_front_01460|hello welcome back
cw5evdziBB4-8-rgb_front_01461|in this segment we're going to be discussing how to make the client comfortable on the massage table
cw5evdziBB4-8-rgb_front_01462|so in this case we're working with a massage table other individuals if they're in chair or in a bed you'll deal with that as it presents itself to you
cw5evdziBB4-8-rgb_front_01463|so molinia do you care to demonstrate with me
cw5evdziBB4-8-rgb_front_01464|i'm going to first have you sit up great
cw5evdziBB4-8-rgb_front_01465|so when the individual gets on the table first we have them sit on the side
cw5evdziBB4-8-rgb_front_01466|can you swing your legs around
cw5evdziBB4-8-rgb_front_01467|there you go
cw5evdziBB4-8-rgb_front_01468|so they first get on the table like this and then we have them swing their legs onto the table great
cw5evdziBB4-8-rgb_front_01469|then slowly lower yourself supporting her back and her head
cw5evdziBB4-8-rgb_front_01470|there we go are you comfortable
cw5evdziBB4-8-rgb_front_01471|i am great
cw5evdziBB4-8-rgb_front_01472|can you lift your knees for me please

cw5evdziBB4-8-rgb_front_01481|great we can do that
cw5evdziBB4-8-rgb_front_01482|so after we find out what the needs are of our client and make sure your client is comfortable then we're set to move on to the next segment
cwLJfXFf9ks-8-rgb_front_01483|the principles of aikido can be applied to daily life in many different situations
cwLJfXFf9ks-8-rgb_front_01484|it can be applied in your family with your spouse with your kids
cwLJfXFf9ks-8-rgb_front_01485|it can be applied at work with an irate boss or co-worker
cwLJfXFf9ks-8-rgb_front_01486|it could be an upset driver
cwLJfXFf9ks-8-rgb_front_01487|it could be somebody with road rage
cwLJfXFf9ks-8-rgb_front_01488|we are going to demonstrate a couple of different techniques to emphasize the principles and why don't we just take a peek
cwLJfXFf9ks-8-rgb_front_01489|for example if there is somebody coming at you with road rage it is probably best not to block not to stop them with your car but just to let them go right by and with aikido it looks something like this
cwLJfXFf9ks-8-rgb_front_01490|i'll show you
cwLJfXFf9ks-8-rgb_front_01491|so that is one way you can just let them go right by
cwLJfXFf9ks-8-rgb_front_01492|if you need to deal with the situation a little bit more it might look something like this
cwLJfXFf9ks-8-rgb_front_01493|in that that last technique as phil comes in and attacks we enter and we face the same direction
cwLJfXFf9ks-8-rgb_front_01494|we can see exactly what they are seeing
cwLJfXFf9ks-8-rgb_front_01495|we can get a little different perspective
cwLJfXFf9ks-8-rgb_front_01496|if we think that we need to deal with the situation a little bit more directly we can just go off the attack immediately
cwLJfXFf9ks-8-rgb_front_01497|as he attacks just turn and go right in
cwLJfXFf9ks-8-rgb_front_01498|everything is blending and harmonizing
cwLJfXFf9ks-8-rgb_front_01499|some can be a little more direct
cwLJfXFf9ks-8-rgb_front_01500|others can just not connect with that energy
cwLJfXFf9ks-8-rgb_front_01501|if it is negative energy or anger or frustration you don't need to deal with it
cwLJfXFf9ks-8-rgb_front_01502|there are many different ways as you can see to deal with each individual situation and aikido principles will help you deal with that in daily life
cxW8HFCWjlQ-8-rgb_front_01503|this yogurt is a bulgarian yogurt that is non fat so it really healthy it is a little more on the sour side as far as yogurts go and most middle eastern yogurt is kind of sour
cxW8HFCWjlQ-8-rgb_front_01504|i would recommend using the middle eastern yogurt if you can on the hummus because this taste more better then the regular yogurt that you get in heb
cxW8HFCWjlQ-8-rgb_front_01505|you can usually find this at heb but if cant go to your middle eastern store and they would have yogurt and you just want to add about 2 tablespoons to your hummus
cxW8HFCWjlQ-8-rgb_front_01506|not only this gives it a great flavor but it also makes the hummus a little liquidly and not as chunky as it would be if it didn't have this
cxW8HFCWjlQ-8-rgb_front_01507|a lot of people use olive oil in there hummus to make it a lot thinner then what it usually is because when you grind up all these garbanzo beans it comes out kind chunky
cxW8HFCWjlQ-8-rgb_front_01508|it's a lot better to get it more puree that way it has a better texture to it
cxW8HFCWjlQ-8-rgb_front_01509|this yogurt as i said is non fat it also comes in a version that is not non fat that you can pick which ever one you like but it is definitely very good yogurt
cxW8HFCWjlQ-8-rgb_front_01510|this one right here is my favorite and i think it is whitemountainfoods
cxW8HFCWjlQ-8-rgb_front_01511|com you can go and order this
cxW8HFCWjlQ-8-rgb_front_01512|i will definitely recommend getting this kind of yogurt so so good
cxW8HFCWjlQ-8-rgb_front_01513|yogurt in the middle east is kind of like ketchup here in the united states so and that is it for the yogurt part of the hummus
dIIMHOX5AD8-8-rgb_front_01514|now that we've covered walking properly lets work on focusing on one point so we're actually moving up the body as we go
dIIMHOX5AD8-8-rgb_front_01515|one point if you could look the center of mass is going to be bellybutton anywhere from 2 to 3 inches down depending so right about where this belt is
dIIMHOX5AD8-8-rgb_front_01516|now one point is the principal of dynamic motion without actual visible motion taking place
dIIMHOX5AD8-8-rgb_front_01517|one way of thinking of it is that if you have somebody it's tensile strength
dIIMHOX5AD8-8-rgb_front_01518|and if you have somebody grab onto your arm they're out to be a living breathing connection that yes they're it feels very strong it feels like a fire hose
dIIMHOX5AD8-8-rgb_front_01519|a fire hose is almost impossible to bend when water is flowing through it
dIIMHOX5AD8-8-rgb_front_01520|it's a living entity and therefore one point is very much the same thing it is a living entity
dIIMHOX5AD8-8-rgb_front_01521|and you are looking for that constant relaxed natural power of tensile strength
dIIMHOX5AD8-8-rgb_front_01522|it's not muscular by any means and it is certainly not structural but there is well i shouldn't say that because there is an aspect of structural to it
dIIMHOX5AD8-8-rgb_front_01523|with correct structure and correct relaxation you build on tensile strength
dIIMHOX5AD8-8-rgb_front_01524|and we will continue on this subject shortly thereafter
dKumOzqVk3M-8-rgb_front_01525|hello this is jb i'm with austin homebrew supply in austin texas
dKumOzqVk3M-8-rgb_front_01526|talking to you today about equipment and process and ingredients that go into making your own beer at your own home
dKumOzqVk3M-8-rgb_front_01527|or wine or cider or socky
dKumOzqVk3M-8-rgb_front_01528|you got a lot of different things you can make here
dKumOzqVk3M-8-rgb_front_01529|so
dKumOzqVk3M-8-rgb_front_01530|one of the things you want to do at the end of or during the process of either making beer especially beer making or even wine is you need to rack or transfer we had some strange terminology here but racking means to transfer from point a to point b
dKumOzqVk3M-8-rgb_front_01531|so especially in beer making a lot of time you're moving hot liquids from one point to another especially if you want to take a hot liquid from a low point and take it to a higher point
dKumOzqVk3M-8-rgb_front_01532|well it's going to be a real difficult to pick up a boiling hot container of liquid and move it
dKumOzqVk3M-8-rgb_front_01533|so so that being said we carry food grade pumps that the reason they're food grade is there's a space between where the motor hosing is the actual pump drive with the magnetic drive between so
dKumOzqVk3M-8-rgb_front_01534|there's a complete difference between the motor and where the actual liquid comes through
dKumOzqVk3M-8-rgb_front_01535|subsequently it's food grade
dKumOzqVk3M-8-rgb_front_01536|in other words there's no way that any kind of oil and or internal petroleums or lubricants can contact the beer or wine that you're moving through here
dKumOzqVk3M-8-rgb_front_01537|so
dKumOzqVk3M-8-rgb_front_01538|these guys are called food grade pumps
dKumOzqVk3M-8-rgb_front_01539|they're made by a company called march and these guys do a great job of moving hot boiling wort or beer from point a to point b without you having to pick up big kettles full of hot broiling liquid
dKumOzqVk3M-8-rgb_front_01540|so
dKumOzqVk3M-8-rgb_front_01541|food grade pumps really come in handy when you're brewing
dQJyDM9pKR8-8-rgb_front_01542|effleurage is a massage stroke that basically just stroking the horse
dQJyDM9pKR8-8-rgb_front_01543|you can do it either with your hands with your fingers closed and just stroking down the side of the horse keeping one hand on the horse all the time while you are doing it
dQJyDM9pKR8-8-rgb_front_01544|or you can have your fingers more open in sort of a combed shape the stroking down the side of the horse starting at the poll and working all the way back
dQJyDM9pKR8-8-rgb_front_01545|that's actually a fairly safe stroke to use either form of effleurage horse's most likely you know almost always enjoy it
dQJyDM9pKR8-8-rgb_front_01546|they don't find it to be too invasive it's not going to be uncomfortable for them and the unless you are being careless it's a fairly safe stroke to be using
dQJyDM9pKR8-8-rgb_front_01547|so again i'm talking about having your hands either with your fingers open like this and just kind of combing on the horse or having your fingers closed and stroking down the sides of the horse
dQJyDM9pKR8-8-rgb_front_01548|and just petting them
dQJyDM9pKR8-8-rgb_front_01549|it's a nice gentle stroke it helps them to relax
dWOtJxrH_Ww-8-rgb_front_01550|i'm tim gipson and i'm going to talk to you about trouble shooting your refrigerator
dWOtJxrH_Ww-8-rgb_front_01551|now if you don't have any power at all to your refrigerator first few things you want to check is you want to check and make sure that the breaker is not tripped in your main breaker box
dWOtJxrH_Ww-8-rgb_front_01552|so you want to locate where that is and you want to check the breaker and make sure it is reset
dWOtJxrH_Ww-8-rgb_front_01553|if it is popped you want to make sure you reset it to the on position
dWOtJxrH_Ww-8-rgb_front_01554|the next thing would be to check the power chord behind the refrigerator and make sure it hasn't come loose from the outlet
dWOtJxrH_Ww-8-rgb_front_01555|so that's basically on the power
dWOtJxrH_Ww-8-rgb_front_01556|now if you still are not do not have power you may need to consult a professional repair service at that point because there could be something internal to the refrigerator
dWOtJxrH_Ww-8-rgb_front_01557|now this particular refrigerator it has all electronic controls so it has its own sensors which really tell you what's going on
dWOtJxrH_Ww-8-rgb_front_01558|this particular model up here if you have some food that may not be staying cool enough you might check your temperature controls
dWOtJxrH_Ww-8-rgb_front_01559|this particular model actually tells you what the degrees are set to
dWOtJxrH_Ww-8-rgb_front_01560|recommended settings are anywhere from about 34 degrees to 38 degrees depending on really how cold you like to keep some of your products particularly dairy products
dWOtJxrH_Ww-8-rgb_front_01561|then the other side here on the freezer side some of the common things you can run in to is whether your ice maker is not distributing ice properly or your water's not coming out
dWOtJxrH_Ww-8-rgb_front_01562|now if water's not coming out most of these are equipped with a filter so in this case this one tells you when it's time to start thinking about ordering a filter and it tells you when to replace it
dWOtJxrH_Ww-8-rgb_front_01563|on the ice occasionally you may just need to come in here where these are frost free freezers this can actually warm up or some of your ice melts together and the agitating arm can actually get stuck
dWOtJxrH_Ww-8-rgb_front_01564|so you want to come in here and break up your ice occasionally
dWOtJxrH_Ww-8-rgb_front_01565|so i'm tim gipson and that's some trouble shooting tips for your refrigerator
d_0dt3VdYCo-8-rgb_front_01566|in tennis a lot of times you're going to get shots that aren't standardized that you're not really prepared for unless you play a lot
d_0dt3VdYCo-8-rgb_front_01567|and the half volley is one of those shots
d_0dt3VdYCo-8-rgb_front_01568|so here's a drill that helps you get the half volley
d_0dt3VdYCo-8-rgb_front_01569|you can use a wall which is great
d_0dt3VdYCo-8-rgb_front_01570|but in this case your practice partner in this case it will be me i'll be throwing the ball to darren
d_0dt3VdYCo-8-rgb_front_01571|so imagine that you've hit a nice shot you're coming to the net or you've hit a nice serve you're coming to the net and your opponent hits a ball that drops by your feet
d_0dt3VdYCo-8-rgb_front_01572|it bounces up and you've got to just block it forward
d_0dt3VdYCo-8-rgb_front_01573|so that's what this drill is
d_0dt3VdYCo-8-rgb_front_01574|so darren is going to demonstrate
d_0dt3VdYCo-8-rgb_front_01575|i'm going to throw it by his feet
d_0dt3VdYCo-8-rgb_front_01576|he's just going to block it forward as he comes to the net
d_0dt3VdYCo-8-rgb_front_01577|so it's just a way of taking a ball
d_0dt3VdYCo-8-rgb_front_01578|you're not really doing much with it
d_0dt3VdYCo-8-rgb_front_01579|you're just blocking it forward
d_0dt3VdYCo-8-rgb_front_01580|now john mcenroe was a master of this shot
d_0dt3VdYCo-8-rgb_front_01581|but you have to have it
d_0dt3VdYCo-8-rgb_front_01582|it's very apropos in doubles that you're able to block the ball back because if they volley it at your feet you've just got to be able to block it right back
d_0dt3VdYCo-8-rgb_front_01583|so what you want to do is just use a whole basket of balls
d_0dt3VdYCo-8-rgb_front_01584|see how many in a row you can make
d_0dt3VdYCo-8-rgb_front_01585|see how many out of 50 you can make and as the number of balls in practice improves your results on the court are also going to improve
d_V_K6ziiNA-8-rgb_front_01586|knots have a long and varied history throughout time and today i'm going to show you how to make one of the great ones
d_V_K6ziiNA-8-rgb_front_01587|my name is robert segundo and i'm going to teach you how to make a clove hitch
d_V_K6ziiNA-8-rgb_front_01588|now a hitch technically isn't a knot but it falls in the same category of kind of the macrame style
d_V_K6ziiNA-8-rgb_front_01589|so what we're going to do is we're going to look down to our table here and we can see i have my rod here that i'm going to attach my line to
d_V_K6ziiNA-8-rgb_front_01590|what i'm going to do is i'm going to take my line initially i'm going to roll it up and over and then bring it under like so
d_V_K6ziiNA-8-rgb_front_01591|then it's going to go over the standing end that was there and i'm going to take my working end back up and over
d_V_K6ziiNA-8-rgb_front_01592|and it's going to come under and then back through the loop like so
d_V_K6ziiNA-8-rgb_front_01593|there you go
d_V_K6ziiNA-8-rgb_front_01594|this is basically two half-hitches put together and this is just a clove hitch
d_V_K6ziiNA-8-rgb_front_01595|and it's really tight
d_V_K6ziiNA-8-rgb_front_01596|i mean you can hold things with it
d_V_K6ziiNA-8-rgb_front_01597|you can't put a whole lot of tension on itbecause it will slip through
d_V_K6ziiNA-8-rgb_front_01598|but it's good enough if you're just trying to hold some items down
d_V_K6ziiNA-8-rgb_front_01599|let's do that one more time
d_V_K6ziiNA-8-rgb_front_01600|let's pull this upand out like so
d_V_K6ziiNA-8-rgb_front_01601|once again we'll go over we'll go under over our standing end
d_V_K6ziiNA-8-rgb_front_01602|and we'll go over like so back under and through the loop we've created and there it is
d_V_K6ziiNA-8-rgb_front_01603|there's our clove hitch
d_V_K6ziiNA-8-rgb_front_01604|my name is robert segundo and enjoy tying knots
eLv9Uhs89IQ-8-rgb_front_01605|hello have you ever wondered how to prepare for a divorce well i'm dr felicia and i'd like to share a few tips with you
eLv9Uhs89IQ-8-rgb_front_01606|preparing for divorce is a very scary and frightening prospect whether you're the male or the female in the relationship
eLv9Uhs89IQ-8-rgb_front_01607|one of the things you want to consider especially if you're the female is that for instance today most court jurisdictions only allow about three years alimony for rehabilitation
eLv9Uhs89IQ-8-rgb_front_01608|so if the partner wanted to go back to school and be career-oriented that's give them three years time in preparation
eLv9Uhs89IQ-8-rgb_front_01609|so that's a pretty frightening prospect in itself
eLv9Uhs89IQ-8-rgb_front_01610|if you already had a career and you're in a working world it's not as quite as frightening but chances are your assets are pretty well divided and you're going to need to start to secure some new aspects for yourself
eLv9Uhs89IQ-8-rgb_front_01611|you want to decide if keeping the house is in your best interest or perhaps the expenses to run the house are just so expensive it's not worth it
eLv9Uhs89IQ-8-rgb_front_01612|you may wish to downsize and put yourself into a situation where you can readily afford it on one person's pay
eLv9Uhs89IQ-8-rgb_front_01613|the other thing that you want to prepare for is housing
eLv9Uhs89IQ-8-rgb_front_01614|if you have children you need to prepare if you're going to have to move and assign them into new schools get them registered
eLv9Uhs89IQ-8-rgb_front_01615|you may need to actually enlist family support for child care
eLv9Uhs89IQ-8-rgb_front_01616|you may need to get all kinds of clothing sorted out in terms of who keeps what belongings and personal belongings in the house who keeps what
eLv9Uhs89IQ-8-rgb_front_01617|and if you are the caretaker of the children you obviously need more than the party who's going to leave without the children
eLv9Uhs89IQ-8-rgb_front_01618|in either case i wish you good luck
eLv9Uhs89IQ-8-rgb_front_01619|and remember it's how to prepare and survive for divorce is never easy
eLv9Uhs89IQ-8-rgb_front_01620|good luck dr felicia goodbye
eRiOhdeskNE-8-rgb_front_01621|alright we've just completed our two flowers
eRiOhdeskNE-8-rgb_front_01622|they've been clear embossed and then they've been embossed with glassy glaze and now what i'm going to do is i'm going to make a center for each of these flower
eRiOhdeskNE-8-rgb_front_01623|and i'm using the jumbo eyelets in my cropodile and i'm just going to go ahead to the middle of that flower using the 3/16th punch
eRiOhdeskNE-8-rgb_front_01624|punch it out and do the same thing with the smaller flower
eRiOhdeskNE-8-rgb_front_01625|punch that out
eRiOhdeskNE-8-rgb_front_01626|and i'm going to be using the pewter eyelets
eRiOhdeskNE-8-rgb_front_01627|and i'm just going to push down
eRiOhdeskNE-8-rgb_front_01628|and sometimes if you're not lined up quite right if you lay it on its front you can push it down a little bit better
eRiOhdeskNE-8-rgb_front_01629|there's one
eRiOhdeskNE-8-rgb_front_01630|and now the second one
eRiOhdeskNE-8-rgb_front_01631|and just push the chipboard back a little bit if you don't have enough room
eRiOhdeskNE-8-rgb_front_01632|alright now we're ready to give this another squeeze and finish that eyelet
eRiOhdeskNE-8-rgb_front_01633|alright
eRiOhdeskNE-8-rgb_front_01634|and then the little one same thing
eRiOhdeskNE-8-rgb_front_01635|alright now we want to hang this off the wreath so i'm going to need a smaller hole
eRiOhdeskNE-8-rgb_front_01636|i need a 3/16th so i'm going to just poke a hole at the tip of the leaf there and at the tip of the leaf there
eRiOhdeskNE-8-rgb_front_01637|and i'm going to be using some natural hemp twine to tie this on to my wreath
eRiOhdeskNE-8-rgb_front_01638|i chose the natural hemp twine because the wreath that i've chosen is the grapevine wreath and you can see i've embossed and glassy glazed a variety of flowers
eRiOhdeskNE-8-rgb_front_01639|i've attached them with the hemp twine and then i've tied it altogether with the 5/8th wide certainly sally or gross grain ribbon to make a beautiful wreath that your mom will be proud to hang on her front door
eY32ru3Nstc-8-rgb_front_01640|i'm going to show you how to make a razberi sunsplash a wonderfully fruity cocktail
eY32ru3Nstc-8-rgb_front_01641|we are going to start off with our ice
eY32ru3Nstc-8-rgb_front_01642|just like so
eY32ru3Nstc-8-rgb_front_01643|pour that into your glass and then we're going to add to that three fourths of an ounce of coconut rum any brand will do so choose your favorite
eY32ru3Nstc-8-rgb_front_01644|you're the one drinking it and i want you to like it
eY32ru3Nstc-8-rgb_front_01645|we're then going to add three-fourths of an ounce of raspberry liqueur
eY32ru3Nstc-8-rgb_front_01646|just like so
eY32ru3Nstc-8-rgb_front_01647|that's going to give it a wonderful fruity flavor
eY32ru3Nstc-8-rgb_front_01648|as is our peachtree schnapps
eY32ru3Nstc-8-rgb_front_01649|also three-fourths of an ounce so equal parts
eY32ru3Nstc-8-rgb_front_01650|then we're going to add in two splashes of grenadine
eY32ru3Nstc-8-rgb_front_01651|uno dos like so
eY32ru3Nstc-8-rgb_front_01652|and about an ounce of orange juice yum
eY32ru3Nstc-8-rgb_front_01653|and then we're going to fill it the rest of the way with pineapple juice
eY32ru3Nstc-8-rgb_front_01654|so this is going to be so wonderfully tropical
eY32ru3Nstc-8-rgb_front_01655|hence the name sunsplash
eY32ru3Nstc-8-rgb_front_01656|go ahead and shake it up
eY32ru3Nstc-8-rgb_front_01657|and if you have a hurricane glass great
eY32ru3Nstc-8-rgb_front_01658|if not you can also serve this in a highball glass
eY32ru3Nstc-8-rgb_front_01659|garnish it with a cherry and there you have it razberi sunsplash
eahjYz2685g-8-rgb_front_01661|now another important thing for you to remember and this is going to be a little difficult because we all tend to like to please people we all tend to like accolades and praise
eahjYz2685g-8-rgb_front_01662|but it's very important that you remember everyone does not have to love your speech
eahjYz2685g-8-rgb_front_01663|everyone does not have to love you
eahjYz2685g-8-rgb_front_01664|i found that out many many years ago as a college professor when i used to try to please all of my students
eahjYz2685g-8-rgb_front_01665|and invariably i would have one or maybe two a semester that just they just didn't like me
eahjYz2685g-8-rgb_front_01666|it didn't matter what i did they didn't like me
eahjYz2685g-8-rgb_front_01667|and that was ok
eahjYz2685g-8-rgb_front_01668|it's ok if one or two people disagree with your speech
eahjYz2685g-8-rgb_front_01669|it's ok if one or two or three people don't like you
eahjYz2685g-8-rgb_front_01670|you have to continue to allow that to be ok you also have to take a look at past failures as a speaker
eahjYz2685g-8-rgb_front_01671|well the last time i did that speech everybody hated it
eahjYz2685g-8-rgb_front_01672|or everybody said i was bad
eahjYz2685g-8-rgb_front_01673|past failures of people not liking your speech or not liking you have nothing to do with present and future presentations
eahjYz2685g-8-rgb_front_01674|maybe that happened before
eahjYz2685g-8-rgb_front_01675|ok so what
eahjYz2685g-8-rgb_front_01676|move on
eahjYz2685g-8-rgb_front_01677|it won't happen this time just because it happened last time
f-mvu_dZvjg-8-rgb_front_01678|a big misconception is that if your dog's tale is waging is that he's happy
f-mvu_dZvjg-8-rgb_front_01679|alot of dogs wag their tales when they are ready to attack as well so the big thing to notice is where your dog's tail is
f-mvu_dZvjg-8-rgb_front_01680|like if his tail is tucked then he's afraid and you should not be petting him at that time and you should not be petting him at that time
f-mvu_dZvjg-8-rgb_front_01681|you never pet a dog when he is afraid because that will make him more afraid
f-mvu_dZvjg-8-rgb_front_01682|if it is laying loosey like this this is just normal
f-mvu_dZvjg-8-rgb_front_01683|when he's waging his tail and it's out here in the middle that means he's happy that's a normal state of mind
f-mvu_dZvjg-8-rgb_front_01684|when the tail starts to go up and it starts to wag like this your dog is probably in a more aggressive state of mind
f-mvu_dZvjg-8-rgb_front_01685|another thing about dogs when you're walking them you'll see their ears perk up if their ears perk up that's them paying more attention
f-mvu_dZvjg-8-rgb_front_01686|but you can see a lot of times that they will get this intense stare when they are fixating on something and when they are fixating on something that's when you need to correct them because that's them being obsessed with that object whether it be a person or another dog or anything like that
f-mvu_dZvjg-8-rgb_front_01687|so it's ok for dogs to look and be curious but if they get that intense obssessive stare then it's going to be threatened
f5EGPzGSCJs-8-rgb_front_01688|today we're going to talk about how to diagnose an ailment of your fish
f5EGPzGSCJs-8-rgb_front_01689|part of keeping a fish is making sure that we visually inspect them everyday
f5EGPzGSCJs-8-rgb_front_01690|when we feed them we want to make sure that they have a good appetite and that their fins are not torn they're not in rough shape they're not sitting at the bottom
f5EGPzGSCJs-8-rgb_front_01691|once you've been keeping your fish for a while you're going to know if they're acting different
f5EGPzGSCJs-8-rgb_front_01692|a common problem with fish is ick which is tiny white spots over the entire fish itself
f5EGPzGSCJs-8-rgb_front_01693|a lot of ailments are caused by stress which can be water quality temperature and fish stressing out other fish themselves
f5EGPzGSCJs-8-rgb_front_01694|one thing that i like to start with if there is a regular ailment going on is using a natural product
f5EGPzGSCJs-8-rgb_front_01695|we have melafix and pemefix melafix is an anti-bacterial and pemefix is an anti-fungal what i like to do is use both of them together because its not an exact science of exactly what's going on with the fish so if there is a bacterial problem we can take care of fungus as well if that happens to be part of the issue as well
f5EGPzGSCJs-8-rgb_front_01696|simply follow directions and it tells you exactly how much to use when you should do a water change
f5EGPzGSCJs-8-rgb_front_01697|another thing that you can put in your tank is aquarium salt
f5EGPzGSCJs-8-rgb_front_01698|aquarium salt raises the electrolytes in the tank and it also helps reduce stress
f5EGPzGSCJs-8-rgb_front_01699|my name is michael and today we're talking about how to diagnose an ailment
fE6xxSbjVV8-8-rgb_front_01700|if there is clay on here what happens is as you come down here and you start taking the clay off the pot see if i don't keep cleaning that tool off all it does is keep going round and round and round
fE6xxSbjVV8-8-rgb_front_01701|sometimes it sticks to your pot sometimes it doesn't
fE6xxSbjVV8-8-rgb_front_01702|so when you get clay on your tool any tool for that matter clean it off set it aside
fE6xxSbjVV8-8-rgb_front_01703|so you start with a nice clean tool so that as you take your tool touch your piece remember this is still kind of sticky your clay trimmings don't transfer from your tool back onto your pot
fE6xxSbjVV8-8-rgb_front_01704|you're trying to get it off of your pot
fE6xxSbjVV8-8-rgb_front_01705|so we're going to come down in here again clean some more of that off
fE6xxSbjVV8-8-rgb_front_01706|see how you have that all down there
fE6xxSbjVV8-8-rgb_front_01707|you have to clean this off
fE6xxSbjVV8-8-rgb_front_01708|sometimes you just get little pieces of clay
fE6xxSbjVV8-8-rgb_front_01709|clean it off you've got a lot of time
fE6xxSbjVV8-8-rgb_front_01710|so you have a nice smoothed out bottom down there
fslsm4MqBBE-8-rgb_front_01712|next we are going to be talking about the edge of a snowboard
fslsm4MqBBE-8-rgb_front_01713|the edge is this metal piece that wraps around the board completely depending on the type of board
fslsm4MqBBE-8-rgb_front_01714|typically with the freestyle board it would have complete wrap around the free ride board would have a complete wrap around an all mountain board would have a complete wrap around but as you got to a jib and rail board that is where it might differ
fslsm4MqBBE-8-rgb_front_01715|on a jib and rail board towards the center of the board there would either be an indentation on the rail or no rail at all on the entire board
fslsm4MqBBE-8-rgb_front_01716|the only other exception to the rule is the magne-traction sidewall which is a seven tooth serrated edge that looks something like this on either side of the board and what that is to do is it is literally supposed to cut into ice
fslsm4MqBBE-8-rgb_front_01717|if you were to have a sidewall like this it might just shave off a nice top layer of it but with a serrated edge you can cut right into it and do better turns
fux-zUwYX2Q-8-rgb_front_01718|and now we're going to go over fireball
fux-zUwYX2Q-8-rgb_front_01719|fireball is a very long-standing staple of the red series of this game
fux-zUwYX2Q-8-rgb_front_01720|it is x and a red much like blaze
fux-zUwYX2Q-8-rgb_front_01721|however fireball is a little different
fux-zUwYX2Q-8-rgb_front_01722|fireball is a sorcery but you may pay the x damage and have it deal to a single creature or play
fux-zUwYX2Q-8-rgb_front_01723|however fireball has the extra added thing that you may deal damage to multiple targets
fux-zUwYX2Q-8-rgb_front_01724|so you would divide that damage evenly among the targets but you also have to pay one additional colorless mana for each additional target
fux-zUwYX2Q-8-rgb_front_01725|so if you were targeting two things you would have to pay one colorless and the red and then you would start counting mana for the x
fux-zUwYX2Q-8-rgb_front_01726|likewise with two three and so forth
fux-zUwYX2Q-8-rgb_front_01727|but you've also got to realize that that x divided evenly rounded down amongst the number of targets
fyI1Ev5m1w4-8-rgb_front_01728|ok now let's talk about turning the compost pile well if it's all good and you put this pile together right you don't have to turn the compost pile
fyI1Ev5m1w4-8-rgb_front_01729|because if you layered it right and you watered it right and you got your microorganisms in there and you put the compost inoculate in there you shouldn't have to turn this pile
fyI1Ev5m1w4-8-rgb_front_01730|now obviously this is a brand new pile that we just made today
fyI1Ev5m1w4-8-rgb_front_01731|but if for some reason your pile didn't cook down which means if your pile is four feet high when it's finished it should be about a foot and a half high
fyI1Ev5m1w4-8-rgb_front_01732|and it should cook down and it should go down and you should be able to see that it looks like compost not like this material
fyI1Ev5m1w4-8-rgb_front_01733|but if you come across your pile and it hasn't done those things then you're going to want to turn your pile
fyI1Ev5m1w4-8-rgb_front_01734|the way we would do that is we would do just like we did in the beginning
fyI1Ev5m1w4-8-rgb_front_01735|we would put holes in the ground so it would drain good
fyI1Ev5m1w4-8-rgb_front_01736|we would create--add some more sticks which we've run out of
fyI1Ev5m1w4-8-rgb_front_01737|but we have plenty in the woods
fyI1Ev5m1w4-8-rgb_front_01738|you would add your leafy--your garden debris for aeration
fyI1Ev5m1w4-8-rgb_front_01739|and then you would start to turn your pile
fyI1Ev5m1w4-8-rgb_front_01740|you would take the top and you would put it on the bottom just like this
